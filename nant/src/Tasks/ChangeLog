	* CompilerBase.cs (WriteOption): New virtual method.  The default
	implementation writes CSC-style command line options, but it can
	be overridden in derived class to write mcs-style command line
	arguments.
	(ExecuteTask): Use the new virtual `WriteOption' method to write
	options.

	* CscTask.cs (WriteOptions): Use the new `WriteOption' method.

	* McsTask.cs: New file.
