	* makefile: Make NAnt.exe dependant on all the *.cs in src and each sub
	dir.  Since we don't remove it on a 'make clean' it doesn't get rebuilt
	when a new file is added or an existing one changed.

	* makefile: Do not remove the NAnt.exe on a 'make clean'.  This would
	prevent other cleans from happening that need nant.

	* makefile: Compile a version of NAnt with Mono's libs.  It only does
	this if you 'make NAnt_mono.exe'. Of course, right now the resulting
	exe probably is not going to work yet becuase of the immature class
	libs.
