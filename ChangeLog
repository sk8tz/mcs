	Added the super-cool set of makefiles from Peter Williams which run on
	GNU/Linux without NAnt.  I named them `makefile.gnu' and not `GNUmakefile'
	since this won't break the windows build.

	To compile stuff on GNU/Linux, just do a `make -f makefile.gnu'.

	* mcs-tool, */makefile.gnu, class/library.make: New files.

	* */makefile (NANT): Use a variable `NANT' so the user can override it with
	`make NANT=/usr/local/bin/NAnt.exe'.

	* AUTHORS: add me to class libraries list

	* makefile (linux): Abandon the build if any of the subdir makes fail

	* makefile: Change order of build so corlib is built before nunit since
	Nunit needs corlib now.

	* makefile: Build mcs/doctools too when one does 'make'

	* on the 'test' target, make sure NUnit is built first before building
	and running tests

	* add nunit directory to the list of dirs to build in
