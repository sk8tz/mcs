	* Tds.cs
	* TdsComm.cs:
		A whole slew of changes to get logon
		to work (it now works in both TDS 7.0
		and TDS 4.2) ... danmorg can test with
		8.0 if he likes.
		TdsComm has some simplifications too,
		because C# has some features not present
		in the Java implementation.
	* TdsConnectionParameters.cs:
		Change a few default values.
	* TdsMessage.cs:
		Implement this class.
