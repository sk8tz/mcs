	* SqliteDataReader.cs: GetFieldType can be called
	  before the reader is positioned on a row.  In that
	  case, return the types for the first row.

	* SqliteCommand.cs: It was revealed that preparing
	  statements ahead of time was not possible as table
	  schema changes lead to errors.  This needed serious
	  reorganization.  SQL syntax errors and BUSY errors
	  are now raised in nice exceptions.
	* SqliteDataReader.cs:
		* Use object[] in place of ArrayList for each row.
		* For Sqlite3, which remembers whether a value was
		  an integer, text, real, or blob, actually return
		  longs, strings, doubles, and byte[]s.
		* GetDataTypeName() works where possible (Sqlite3).
		* INT/INTEGER columns are now returned as ints,
		  rather than longs, for Sqlite3.  Similarly for
		  DATE and DATETIME columns, now returning DateTimes.
	* SqliteConnection.cs.cs: BeginTransaction(IsolationLevel)
	  throws InvalidOperationException per the MS docs.
	* SqliteExceptions.cs: New file with SqliteSyntaxException,
	  SqliteExecutionException, and its subclass SqliteBusyException.

	* SqliteCommand.cs: Use non-obsolete UnixMarshal members.

2005-10-06  Chris Lahey  <clahey@localhost.localdomain>

	* SqliteCommand.cs (Prepare): Use UnixMarshal here to get proper
	utf8 behavior.

	* Sqlite.cs, SqliteCommand.cs: Report string error messages
	in prepare, for version 3.

2005-07-26  Joshua Tauberer <tauberer@for.net>

	SQL commands can have multiple statements within them (i.e.
	separated by semicolons).  Sqlite has to be instructed to
	process each command.
	
	* Sqlite.cs: Pass the sql command as an IntPtr so we can
	  see where pzTail takes us.
	* SqliteCommand.cs: Lazily load sql_params for good measure.
	  Iterate compile/prepare until each statement in the string
	  has been processed, and retain pointers to each compiled
	  statement.  When executing, run all of the statements.

	* Sqlite.cs:
	- Added sqlite3_bind_* for native Sqlite3 Parameters
	* SqliteCommand.cs
	- Added methods for parameter processing/binding (sqlite3 uses bind / sqlite2 uses regEx to extract parameters)
	- Sqlite uses ':' as delimeter!
	* SqliteParameterCollection.cs
	- Chris Turchin fixed a problem in the Parameter Hashmap
	* SqliteTransaction.cs
	- The CommandText for the Rollback Command was "COMMIT" ! ->changed :)

	* SqliteConnection.cs:
	- SetConnectionString: trim white spaces, ignore empty connection
	string options.
	- SetConnectionString: if file://,db_file starts from pos 7 not 6.
