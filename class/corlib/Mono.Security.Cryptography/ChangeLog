	* DSAManaged.cs: Added an event after key generation (so that
	DSACryptoServiceProvider can persist the keypair if required). Added
	PublicOnly property (like 1.2) so we do not have to catch an exception
	to know if a private key is present or not. Added a Random property so
	we do not always have to create a RNG instance (not always required).
	* RSAManaged.cs: Added an event after key generation (so that
	DSACryptoServiceProvider can persist the keypair if required). Added
	PublicOnly property (like 1.2) so we do not have to catch an exception
	to know if a private key is present or not.
	* SymmetricTransform.cs: This class was split from S.S.C.
	SymmetricAlgorithm.cs so it could be reused in Mono.Security 
	assembly for other symmetric algorithms transforms.

	* KeyPairPersistence.cs: New. Class to persist keypairs in an XML
	format to mimic the CryptoAPI key containers.

	* CryptoConvert.cs: RSA doesn't start with a Q - at least that what
	a strongname told me. Sorry Ron :(

	* MACAlgorithm.cs: Fixed difference between 1.0 and 1.1 framework. 
	The 1.0 framework is adding an additional  padding block (empty) 
	to MAC when MACing an exact multiple of the TripleDES block size.
	* PKCS1.cs: Fixed a typo which prevented "lame" (without OID) 
	signature verification.

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Fixed strongname generation for small exponents 
	(like 17). Part of the fixed for bug #50341.

2003-10-17  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Added from Mono.Security to support StrongNames.

2003-07-05  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* DSAManaged.cs: Fixed bugs that appeared with the new unit tests.
	* RSAManaged.cs: Fixed bugs that appeared with the new unit tests.

	* PKCS1.cs DSAManaged.cs: Changed strange characters in comments to 
	human-readable ones, since they break XML export in monocov.

2003-06-15  Sebastien Pouliot <spouliot@motus.com>

	* RSAManaged.cs: Now includes CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem) 
	optimization when using the private key (DecryptValue). This
	cut more than 5 seconds of nunit on my system (out of 14 sec
	for complete asymmetric tests). Thanks to Ben Maurer for help!

2003-06-11  Sebastien Pouliot <spouliot@motus.com>

	* DSAManaged.cs: Refactored from DSACryptoServiceProvider.cs. Cannot
	be reused outside [ms]corlib because DSA constructor is internal :-(

	* PKCS1.cs: Now support any hash algorithm when encoding PKCS 1.5
	(i.e. not limited to pre-calculated values for known hashes). Some
	other API changes to ease the use of other hash algorithms.

	* RSAManaged.cs: Refactored from RSACryptoServiceProvider.cs. This 
	class is required for custom PKCS#1 padding in SSL (which is not 
	possible using RSACryptoServiceProvider).

2003-05-12  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* PKCS1.cs: Corrected I2OSP to match PKCS#1 v.2.1 test vector
	and fix the OAEP incompatibility issue.

2003-04-01  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* PKCS1.cs: Corrected fix (partially) for the lame PKCS1 v1.5
	signatures done without specifying an OID.

	* PKCS1.cs: Fix for some (lame) PKCS1 v1.5 signatures done
	without specifying an OID.

2003-02-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* CryptoTools.cs: Renamed namespace to match new location.
	* PKCS1.cs: Renamed namespace to match new location.
	* HMACAlgorithm.cs: New. Generic class to implement HMAC
	using any hash algorithm (was in S.S.C.HMACSHA1.cs).
	* MACAlgorithm.cs: New. Generic class to implement MAC
	using any symmetric algorithm (was in S.S.C.MACTripleDES.cs).
