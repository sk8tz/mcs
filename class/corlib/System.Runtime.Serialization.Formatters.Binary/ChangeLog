	* BinaryCommon.cs: Added UseReflectionSerialization property.
	* CodeGenerator.cs, ObjectWriter.cs: When serializing the name of an 
	  inherited field, prefix the name with the class name. This fixes #54439.
	  Moved check for reflection serialization variable to BinaryCommon.

	* ObjectWriter.cs: Factorized some serialization code in new classes, so it
	  is now possible to use fast IL generated classes that use direct access
	  to class fields instead of using reflection.
	* CodeGenerator.cs: New file. Has several methods used by ObjectWriter to 
	  generate serialization code.

	* ObjectWriter.cs: Get the assembly of a member from the member's type, not
	  from the type of the value, because that is the type written in the
	  metadata section of the object.

2003-12-23  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* ObjectReader.cs: Field names can include the type name if the field
	  belongs to a base type. Take this into account.

2003-11-26  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* BinaryFormatter.cs: Added missing methods.

2003-11-20  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* BinaryFormatter.cs, MessageFormatter.cs, ObjectReader.cs: Added support
	  for TypeFilter property.

2003-11-16  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* BinaryFormatter.cs, MessageFormatter.cs, ObjectWriter.cs: 
	  Implemented support for AssemblyFormat property.

2003-11-12  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* ObjectReader.cs, ObjectWriter.cs: Changed some GetType calls to "is" checks.

	* BinaryFormatter.cs (WriteBinaryHeader): changed from public to
	private.

2003-07-25  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

    * MessageFormatter.cs: WriteMethodCall(): It must write all parameters,
      including ref and out.

2003-07-24  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

    * ObjectReader.cs, ObjectWriter.cs, BinaryCommon.cs: Fixed bug #45970.

2003-07-17  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

    * ObjectReader.cs: Keep MemberInfo members in type's metadata object, so it is
      not necessary to query them for every object.
    * ObjectWriter.cs: If the value being serialized is a value type (not boxed)
      then there is no need to register it in the ObjectIDGenerator, because it is
      not possible to have two references to the same value type object.

2003-05-13  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ideary.com>

    * ObjectReader.cs: Changed signature of ReadObjectGraph, so now it returns the
      deserialized object and the headers.
    * MessageFormatter.cs: The result of the call to the HeaderHandler delegate is
      now interpreted as the uri of the target object. This seems to be MS.NET
      behavior.
	* BinaryFormatter.cs: Deserialize now calls the HeaderHandler delegate,
	  if provided.

2003-02-25  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ideary.com>

	  before fixup. Closes bug #37842.

2003-02-04  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ideary.com>

    * MessageFormatter.cs: Corrected some bugs that affected serialization of exceptions

    * MessageFormatter.cs: Implemented serialization of message properties.

2003-01-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* ObjectReader.cs (ReadNextObject): Call
	RaiseDeserializationEvent() on the ObjectManager when we're done
	reading the whole graph.

2003-01-24  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ideary.com>

	from beta days)

	* BinaryFormatter.cs: Stubbed out
