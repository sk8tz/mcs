    * ObjectReader.cs: Keep MemberInfo members in type's metadata object, so it is
      not necessary to query them for every object.
    * ObjectWriter.cs: If the value being serialized is a value type (not boxed)
      then there is no need to register it in the ObjectIDGenerator, because it is
      not possible to have two references to the same value type object.

    * ObjectReader.cs: Changed signature of ReadObjectGraph, so now it returns the
      deserialized object and the headers.
    * MessageFormatter.cs: The result of the call to the HeaderHandler delegate is
      now interpreted as the uri of the target object. This seems to be MS.NET
      behavior.
	* BinaryFormatter.cs: Deserialize now calls the HeaderHandler delegate,
	  if provided.
