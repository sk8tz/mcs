This directory contains support for Unicode normalization and collation.

This directory contains several files to be autogenerated:

	- MSCompatUnicodeTable.cs : support for CompareInfo.
	- Normalization.cs : support for String.Normalize()
	- CollationElementTable.cs : used in code generators which generate
	  above two sources.

Targets in Makefile often downloads dependency files, such as Unicode
Character Database files. They are fed to source generators which are written
in C# sources.

Many of the files in this directory are subject to change (for example,
being rewritten to generate resource files and possibly C header like
char-conversions.h and culture-info-table.h in the later stage).
