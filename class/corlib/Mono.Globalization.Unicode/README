This directory contains support for Unicode normalization and collation.

** build

	- run "make" in this directory. It requires internet access for the
	  first time to download dependency files from the web.

	- apply "managed-collation.patch" in this directory.

** use

	Set environment MONO_USE_MANAGED_COLLATION=yes.

	Note that it is still highly unstable and not ready to be used yet.
	Currently it is lilely to lead a Catastrophe.

** generated files

	There are several files to be autogenerated:

	- MSCompatUnicodeTableGenerated.cs : support for collation, but
	  for standalone testing purpose.
	- Normalization.cs : support for String.Normalize()
	- CollationElementTable.cs : used in code generators which generate
	  above two sources.
	- ../collation.core.bin,
	  ../collation.tailoring.bin,
	  ../collation.cjkCHS.bin,
	  ../collation.cjkCHT.bin,
	  ../collation.cjkJA.bin,
	  ../collation.cjkKO.bin,
	  ../collation.cjkKOlv2.bin : collation table binary resoueces.

	Run "make" to generate those files. At least binary resources are
	required when you applied the patch.

** notes

	Many of the files in this directory are subject to change (for
	example, being rewritten to generate resource files and possibly
	C header like char-conversions.h and culture-info-table.h in the
	later stage).
