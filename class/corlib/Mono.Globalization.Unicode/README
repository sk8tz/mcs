This directory contains support for Unicode normalization and collation.

** enable collation

	To use culture-sensitive comparison, set environment 
	MONO_USE_MANAGED_COLLATION=yes.

	mscorlib.dll will be replaced to use this collation by default and
	then it will become MONO_USE_UNMANAGED_COLLATION=yes after the next
	release.

** generated files

	There are several files to be autogenerated:

	- MSCompatUnicodeTableGenerated.cs : support for collation, but
	  for standalone testing purpose.
	- Normalization.cs : support for String.Normalize()
	- CollationElementTable.cs : used in code generators which generate
	  above two sources.
	- ../collation.core.bin,
	  ../collation.tailoring.bin,
	  ../collation.cjkCHS.bin,
	  ../collation.cjkCHT.bin,
	  ../collation.cjkJA.bin,
	  ../collation.cjkKO.bin,
	  ../collation.cjkKOlv2.bin : collation table binary resoueces.

	To generate those files, run "make" in this directory. It requires 
	internet access for the first time to download dependency files from
	the web.
