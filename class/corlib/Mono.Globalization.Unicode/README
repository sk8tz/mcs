This directory contains support for Unicode normalization and collation.

This branch contains Normalization.cs and CollationElementTable.cs which
can be built from generator executables and Unicode Character Database found
at unicode.org (see Makefile for details).

Many of the files in this directory are subject to change (for example,
being rewritten to generate C header like char-conversions.h and
culture-info-table.h).
