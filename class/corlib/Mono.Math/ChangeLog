	* BigInteger.cs: Added INSIDE_CORLIB to define ModulusRing as 
	internal. Without this the unit tests for Mono.Math (now in
	Mono.Security assembly) wont compile (see bugzilla #44845).

	* BigInteger.cs: Fix prob. prime test for small numbers (Pieter Philippaerts)

2003-06-11  Sebastien Pouliot <spouliot@motus.com>

	* BigInteger.cs: Added Clear to zeroize big integers and code to allow
	compares with null (because operators == and != are re-defined). Note:
	The class may still leak some private info in temp arrays (thanks Ben).

	* BigInteger.cs: New, much faster, version by Ben Maurer. 
	Warning: this version requires "unsafe" compilation switch
	(which isn't a problem in corlib but may be elsewhere)

2003-02-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* BigInteger.cs: Renamed namespace to match new location.
