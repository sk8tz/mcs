	* X509Certificate.cs: Completed CreateFromSignedFile. Added a new 
	internal constructor so Publisher (and the related classes) can 
	create a X509Certificate object which return null dates (for both 
	GetEffectiveDateString and GetExpirationDateString methods).

	* X509Certificate.cs: Fixed the date issue. MS implementation always
	return the local time for Pacific (GMT-8). Added ToString() and changed
	some protected to private to please corcompare.

	* X509Certificate.cs: Updated some DN cases and some minor time issues.
	GetEffectiveDateString and GetExpirationDateString still don't match 
	MS implementation (however they seems, most of the time, to be on par 
	with the Windows Certificate Viewer - crtmgr.exe).

	* ChangeLog: New. First entry ;-)
	* X509Certificates.cs: New. Almost complete - except 
	CryptoAPI link, CreateFromSignedFile and some date issues.
