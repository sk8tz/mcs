	* X509Certificate.cs: Updated some DN cases and some minor time issues.
	GetEffectiveDateString and GetExpirationDateString still don't match 
	MS implementation (however they seems, most of the time, to be on par 
	with the Windows Certificate Viewer - crtmgr.exe).

	* ChangeLog: New. First entry ;-)
	* X509Certificates.cs: New. Almost complete - except 
	CryptoAPI link, CreateFromSignedFile and some date issues.
