	* X509Certificate.cs: Implements X509Certificate(IntPtr)
	constructor for compatibility with CryptoAPI.

2003-04-23  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509Certificate.cs: Fixed issues for null certificate 
	(special case where object exists without any certificate)
	which made PublisherTest fails.

2003-03-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509Certificate.cs: Now use Mono.Security.X509.X509Certificate.

2003-02-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509Certificate.cs: Changes to refer Mono.Security (for ASN1)

2002-12-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* ASN1.cs: New. Updated ASN1 classes for X509Certificate that can
	now be reused for other tools (like Cert2Spc). Classes are marked
	internal so they cannot be reused from outside corlib (for 
	compatibility with MS implementation).
	* X509Certificate.cs: Removed all ASN1 classes from file.	

2002-12-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509Certificate.cs: Fixed the date issue (again). Time was 
	converted to local time then ajusted to Pacific time. Now time
	is kept (internally) as UTC and correct (-8) to Pacific when shown.
	Changed Authenticode signature detection and removed debugging code.

2002-12-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509Certificate.cs: Completed CreateFromSignedFile. Added a new 
	internal constructor so Publisher (and the related classes) can 
	create a X509Certificate object which return null dates (for both 
	GetEffectiveDateString and GetExpirationDateString methods).

2002-12-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509Certificate.cs: Fixed the date issue. MS implementation always
	return the local time for Pacific (GMT-8). Added ToString() and changed
	some protected to private to please corcompare.

2002-11-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509Certificate.cs: Updated some DN cases and some minor time issues.
	GetEffectiveDateString and GetExpirationDateString still don't match 
	MS implementation (however they seems, most of the time, to be on par 
	with the Windows Certificate Viewer - crtmgr.exe).

2002-11-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* ChangeLog: New. First entry ;-)
	* X509Certificates.cs: New. Almost complete - except 
	CryptoAPI link, CreateFromSignedFile and some date issues.
