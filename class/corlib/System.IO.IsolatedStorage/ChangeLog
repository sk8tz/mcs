	- General: Get a simple implementation working.  Simple, not-all-there, but
	  sufficient to get "Programming C#" example 21-17 working under Mono.  This
	  doesn't say much, as it's not a stress-test by any means.
	* INormalizeForIsolatedStorage.cs: re-indent to fit mono code style
	* IsolatedStorage.cs: match mono coding guidelines
	* IsolatedStorageFileStream.cs: Add members that "C# In A Nutshell" claims
	  the class should override.  Most of these members just delegate to the
	  base class, though.  CreateIsolatedPath is used to get the actual filename
	  for the IsolatedStorageFileStream.
	* IsolatedStorageScope.cs: Documentation goes in monodoc, so there's no
	  point in having C# doc-tags.  Add "Roaming" member, which "C# In A
	  Nutshell" lists.
	* IsolatedStorageFile.cs: Public class documented in "C# In A Nutshell".
	  Simple implementation.  Will probably need work to conform with .NET,
	  address security concerns.
	* IsolatedStorageInfo.cs: Abstract IsolatedStorage information used by other
	  classes, such as the directory isolated storage is located under, how to
	  calculate the size of isolated storage, etc.

	* IsolatedStorageFileStream.cs: Added MonoTODO here. This class
	is completely stubbed out (over the summer) and didn't get
	properly MonoTODO'd.

	* IsolatedStorage.cs: Looked at MemberInfo.cs, another fellow
	abstract class. Oh, that's what it means! Removed unnesscessary
	MonoTODO attributes.

	* IsolatedStorage.cs: Added to CVS, stubbed out the API.
	* IsolatedStorageException.cs: Implemented.
