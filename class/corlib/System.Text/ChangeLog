	* StringBuilder.cs: Throw exceptions when constructor paramter(s) are
		invalid. Just like MS does (as best as I can tell).

	Tests for these exceptions are now added to the unit tests as well.

	* StringBuilder.cs: Throw exception if they try to make a StringBuilder
		whose capacity is greater than the MaxCapacity.

	I added some tests for the constructors and the above exception. More
	coming soon.

	* StringBuilder.cs: Refactored constructor code into just one
	constructor. All the other construtors call it. Also supplied missing
	constructors so the class has all those in the spec.

	Added the MaxCapacity property as well, however this needs to be 
	completed to return a value is related to the available system memory.

	* Encoding.cs, UTF8Encoding.cs, UTF7Encoding.cs, ASCIIEncoding.cs,
	UnicodeEncoding.cs: Corrected API.

	* UTF8Encoding.cs: Checked in changes from Rafael.

	* UTF8Encoding.cs: impl. clumsy GetBytes

	* StringBuilder.cs (Text): Fixed.

	* StringBuilderTest.cs: Implement Test suite.

2001-07-12  Marcin Szczepanski <marcins@zipworld.com.au>

	* StringBuilder.cs: Implemented.

	The only methods left unimplemented are the AppendFormat( ... )
	ones just because it's probably better to wait until some of the
	Format related classes are implemented.  I've put that as a TODO
	comment at the top and created the methods with a "nop" body.

	* UnicodeEncoding.cs: Members added so that a clean compile is
	possible.

	* ASCIIEncoding.cs: Members added so that a clean compile is
	possible.

	* UTF7Encoding.cs: Members added so that a clean compile is
	possible.

	* UTF8Encoding.cs: Members added so that a clean compile is
	possible.

	* Encoding.cs: All public members included.  Most members
	unimplemented.
