2002-08-17  Eduardo Garcia Cebollero <kiwnix@yahoo.es>

	* AllTests.cs: added BinaryReaderTest.Suite.
	* BinaryReaderTest.cs: New file.

2002-06-12  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* StringReaderTest.cs: Regression test for a bug that we had were
	ReadLine() was not returning null when the string ended with newline.

2002-05-15  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* StreamReaderTest.cs: 
	* StreamWriterTest.cs: 
	Make sure invalid file name has invalid characters in it.  These are 
	platform dependant.

2002-05-14  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* FileTest.cs: Delete temporary files after each test method; Catch
	unexpected exceptions and report them; Make some Assert messages
	unique; Make sure temp files exist before trying Move and Delete, etc.

2002-05-13  Mike Gray <mike@mikegray.org>

	* FileTest.cs: Adding better tests for File.Delete, File.Move

2002-05-12  Mike Gray <mike@mikegray.org>

	* FileTest.cs: Adding better tests for File.Exists, File.Create,
	and File.Copy

2002-05-12  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* StringTest.cs: Add a couple more tests.
	* PathTest.cs: Make tests work a bit better on W32 and Linux.

2002/05/10  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* StreamWriterTest.cs: Use "resources" directory and use OS friendly
	directory separator characters.  This makes the tests run correctly
	against MS.NET, but not yet in mono on Linux.

2002/05/08  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* FileTest.cs: Use "resources" directory and use OS friendly
	directory separator characters.  This makes the tests run correctly
	against MS.NET, but not yet in mono on Linux.

2002-05-08  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* StreamWriter.cs: Wrap a try-catch around block of code to find out
	what exception is being thrown when it shouldn't.

2002-05-07  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* FileTest.cs: Added TestOpen() from Mike Gray.
	* AllTests.cs: Added missing FileTest.Suite as pointed out by Mike 
	as well.

2002-05-05  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* StreamReaderTest.cs: Change location of sample file. In some places,
	use memory stream instead of file stream to eliminate reliance on file 
	io for now.  That area is still a bit immature. Added a bunch of 
	markers to tell where errors were occuring.

	* resources: New directory to hold files open/read, etc. by unit
	tests.

2002-05-01  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* StreamReaderTest.cs:
	* StreamWriterTest.cs: Catch and display exception info where it wasn't
	being caught before.

2002-03-02  Jason Diamond  <jason@injektilo.org>

	* StringReader.cs: Added test for peeking and reading at the end of
	a string.

2002-02-28  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* MemoryStreamTest.cs 
	* StreamWriterTest.cs 
	* StringReaderTest.cs: Fix test bugs found by running against mscorlib.
	AssertEquals() requires the expected and atual values to be the same
	type if they are to be considered equal.

2002-02-05  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* FileTest.cs: Added to CVS. However, this portion of the code
	can't be tested right now.

2002-01-20 Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* AllTests.cs: removed duplicate MemoryStream test
	* MemoryStreamTest.cs: wrapped try-catch blocks around read/write/seek
	tests. These were throwing exceptions that NUnit wasn't catching.  I 
	don't think it used to behave this way before .NET.1.0.
