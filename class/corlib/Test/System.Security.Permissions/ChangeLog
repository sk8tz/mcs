	* FileIOPermissionTest.cs: Use Unix paths if it looks like we are not
	running the tests on Windows. Need to expand this when we run the
	tests on Mac OS's (and others I suppose).  Also consolidated some
	redundant code.

	* FileIOPermissionTest.cs: Remove intersect test where it was trying
	to intersect a permission with itself.  This throws an exception
	with mscorlib.
