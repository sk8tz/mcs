2002-05-19  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* TheTests.cs: Removed.

	* MartinTests.cs: Removed.

	* corlib_test.build: Don't create Runtest.corlib.exe anymore.

2002/05/07  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* AllTests.cs: Do not run the System.Net tests from here, they belong
	in the System assembly tests.

2002-04-27  Lawrence Pit <loz@cable.a2000.nl>

	* System.Security/: added directory
	* AllTests.cs: added Syste,Security suite.

2002-04-15  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* System.Net/: added directory.
	* AllTests.cs: added System.Net suite.

2002/04/04 Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

 	* corlib_test.build: Again; disable running of NUnit tests against mono 
	corlib.  There are so many icalls now, that these tests need
	to be run inside mint and mono.  Will change this soon to run
	the tests using both.  It still runs the tests against the mscorlib
	to validate the tests themselves.

2002-03-31  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* corlib_test.build: don't exclude IntegerFormatterTest.

	* System/AllTests.cs: added IntegerFormatterTest suite.

	* System/IntegerFormatterTest.cs: totally reworked to use NUnit. Right
	now it fails cause I haven't implemented Parse () methods yet. With
	corlib_reference.dll runs ok.

2002/03/28  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* corlib_test.build: Re-exclude it in a couple of places where it was
	breaking the build.  This test is not an NUnit test.  So, it doesn't 
	belong in these dll's until it's made a proper NUnit test.

2002-03-28  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* corlib_test.build: remove two more lines that excluded
	IntegerFormatterTest.

2002/03/28  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* corlib_test.build: Don't exclude IntegerFormatterTest any more.

2002-03-20  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* corlib_test.build: On 'clean' remove all the dll's and pdb's

2002/03/19  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* corlib_test.build: Re-include tests into the build.

2002-03-18  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* corlib_test.build: build RunTests.corlib.exe with only mono class
	libs. This tells what we are missing to run the tests.

2002/03/18  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* corlib_test.build: disable running of NUnit tests against mono 
	corlib.  There are so many icalls now, that these tests need
	to be run inside mint and mono.  Will change this soon to run
	the tests using both.  It still runs the tests against the mscorlib
	to validate the tests themselves.

2002/03/07  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* corlib_test.build: resolve chicken and egg problem. Only build and 
	execute test assemblies when 'make test' is specified. Need to do a
	'make' first now before 'make test'.

2002-03-03  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* corlib_test.build: Turn on debug flag for complier so that...well...
	debugging is easier.

2002-03-01  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* System.Runtime.Serialization/ObjectIDGeneratorTests.cs: Added
	test for System.Runtime.Serialization.ObjectIDGenerator.

2002-02-27  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* RunTests.cs: Removed. This is now in the nant directory.

	* corlib_test.build: Don't link TheTests.cs into the dlls, renamed
	RunTests.exe to RunTests.corlib.exe and link it against NUnitBase.dll.

2002-02-27  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* scan-tests.pl: Moved to ../../../tools/.

2002-02-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MartinTests.cs: New file. This contains all the tests which already
	work on Linux.

	* RunTests.cs: A small custom testrunner to run the tests on Linux.

	* scan-tests.pl: Call this perl script with either MartinTests.cs or
	AllTests.cs as argument and redirect the output the TheTests.cs - it'll
	create a file which calls all the tests.

	* TheTests.cs: This is automatically generated from scan-tests.pl but
	needs some manual editing, so it's in CVS.

	* corlib_test.build: In addition to the libraries, create an executable
	called RunTests.exe which contains all the tests and the custom test
	runner. You can run this executable on Windows to test things with
	mscorlib or on Linux using the mono runtime.

2002-02-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* */*.cs: added zero-args constructors for all the test classes.

2002-02-21  Mark Crichton <crichton@gimp.org>

	* System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProviderTest.cs:
	Fixed typo

2002-02-21  Mark Crichton <crichton@gimp.org>

	* Addded System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProviderTest.cs
	* System.Security.Cryptography/AllTests.cs: Added
	RNGCryptoServiceProviderTest.

2002-02-17  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* Added System/GuidTest.cs

2002-02-10  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* corlib_test.build: Remove duplicate excludes for 
	* AllTests.cs: Add System.Security.Policy tests.  However, commented
	this out because NUnit is throwing an exception.  Need to figure
	that out first.
	
2002-02-09  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* corlib_test.build: compile with mscorlib to test the tests.  This
	will be our "reference" check to make sure the tests work.

2002-01-25  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* AllTests.cs: Add System.Resources.AllTests.Suite

2002-01-14  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* AllTests.cs: Add System.Security.Permissions.AllTests.Suite

2002-01-05  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* .cvsignore: ignore the debug files *.pdb

	* Added System/TimeSpanTest.cs

2002-01-04  John R. Hicks <angryjohn69@nc.rr.com>

	* corlib_test.build: Include test for Queue in the dll

2001-10-15  Martin Weindel <martin.weindel@t-online.de>

        * added System/DecimalTest.cs and System/DecimalTest2.cs

2001-10-11  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* System/StringTest.cs: Added.

2001-10-10  Thomas Neidhart <tome@sbox.tugraz.at>

	* added directory System.Security.Cryptography 
	* added TestSuite for all Crypto classes 
	* added tests for System.Security.Cryptography.AsymmetricAlgorithm 
	and System.Security.Cryptography.SymmetricAlgorithm
    
2001-10-02  Martin Weindel <martin.weindel@t-online.de>

	* added directory System 
	* added tests for System.Int64

2001-08-29  Alexander Klyubin <klyubin@aqris.com>
  
	* Added tests for System.Diagnostics.StackFrame and
	System.Diagnostics.StackTrace. The tests only run against
	Microsoft's implementation as StackTrace and StackFrame classes in
	Mono are not yet properly implemented.
    
	Note that StackFrameTest runs properly only if compiled with
	/debug switch.
