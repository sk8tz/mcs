  * Added tests for System.Diagnostics.StackFrame and
    System.Diagnostics.StackTrace. The tests only run against Microsoft's
    implementation as StackTrace and StackFrame classes in Mono are not yet
    properly implemented.
    
    Note that StackFrameTest runs properly only if compiled with /debug switch.
