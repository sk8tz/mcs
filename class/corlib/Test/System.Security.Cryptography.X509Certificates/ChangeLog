	* X509SpcTest.cs: OK, I misread the test and the file is created by the
	test itself.  I've un-ingored the test, but it still fails for me.
	Entered bugzilla #51057 for this.

2003-11-14  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* X509SpcTest.cs: Ignore for now test where we need an exe to load.

2003-10-12  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509SpcTest.cs: New. Test for Software Publisher Certificates
	(a.k.a. Authenticode) using CreateFromSignedFile.

2003-07-02  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* X509CertificateTest.cs: Ok, must be a bug in our impl of X509Cert.
	Putting it back the way it was.

2003-06-30  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* X509CertificateTest.cs: Adjust for time zone.  Need to test on .NET.

2003-05-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509CertificateTest.cs: Commented some tests in Certificate13 (the
	DSA certificate without any key parameters) because MS implementation
	cannot use the X509Certificate(X509Certificate) to instance it.

2003-05-16  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509CertificateTest.cs: Added DSA certificate without any key 
	parameters (shared group is available in the issuer certificate).

	* X509CertificateTest.cs: Fixed DateTime issue by setting 
	CultureInfo to "". Thanks Nick!

2003-04-12  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509CertificateTest.cs: Commented ToString() test because of the
	dates included within (which makes the comparison with a pre-
	generated value difficult).

2003-04-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509CertificateTest.cs: Corrected end-of-line issue for Linux. 

2003-03-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509CertificateTest.cs: Updated tool to generate test for NUnit2.

2002-12-28  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509CertificateTest.cs: Changed how the dates are compared. This
	should stop the nunit errors in X509Certificate.

2002-12-21  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* all: make tests build and run under nunit2

2002-12-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* X509CertificateTest.cs: Uncommented the GetEffectiveDateString and 
	GetExpirationDateString tests. Added a test for ToString(true).

2002-11-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* AllTests.cs: New. Include all (1) tests files for X509Certificates.
	* X509CertificateTest.cs: New. Generated tests using some (11 right 
	now) X.509 certificates. There is a bigger version (346 certs today)
	to spot new problems (but once spotted they move into this small file).
	GetEffectiveDateString and GetExpirationDateString tests are commented.
