	* AllTests.cs: New. Include all (1) tests files for X509Certificates.
	* X509CertificateTest.cs: New. Generated tests using some (11 right 
	now) X.509 certificates. There is a bigger version (346 certs today)
	to spot new problems (but once spotted they move into this small file).
	GetEffectiveDateString and GetExpirationDateString tests are commented.
