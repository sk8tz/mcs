2002-04-08  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* EnumTest.cs: Add a few tests for differently underlying types and
	the [Flags] attribute to test ToString().

2002-04-08  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* EnumTest.cs: Add test for ToString for the case where the enum
	has [Flags] on it, and a mask value is used.

2002-04-04  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* EnumTest.cs: Change one Assert() message string so the two are 
	unique. And clean up exception catching logic.

2002/03/28  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* IntegerFormatterTest.cs: Eliminate warnings about unused exception
	variables.

2002-03-28  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* EnumTest.cs(TestFormat): Use Fail() instead of AssertEquals() in
	try-catch blocks. Add test to check if correct exception is being 
	thrown.

2002/03/18  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ByteTest.cs:
	* Int64Test.cs:
	* SByteTest.cs: Do not hard code the "$" as the currency symbol to
	use for Parse tests. This isn not really the fix we need. These
	number formats vary wildly depending on the culture the system
	runs with.  We need a much better strategy here for testing this.
	* Int32Test.cs: Use #if NOTYET-#endif to disable a test.  This removes
	an annoying compile warning.

2002-03-18  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DoubleTest.cs:
	* EnumTest.cs: Add unique identifier to Assert()'s. Needed to find
	which one was faling on Linux.

2002-03-12  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Add tests for IList methods and for enumerator on
	an array with non-zero lower bounds.

2002-03-09  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Enable the enumerator test and include test for
	Multi-dimensional array enumerator.  Also include test for
	mutation _not_ invalidating the enumerator.

2002-03-09  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* Int16Test.cs, Int32Tests.cs, UInt16Tests.cs: Use "en-US" culture and
	don't let the user override.

	* Int32Tests.cs: Cleanup. Use unique names in Assert()s, use AssertEquals()
	where appropriate etc.

2002-03-08  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* StringTest.cs: More String.Split tests.

2002-03-07  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* StringTest.cs: Added a few more tests for the bug fixes I just
	committed to String.cs.

2002-03-07  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Fixed the FIXME in test #E05.

2002-03-06  Duco Fijma  <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* CharEnumeratorTest.cs: made test regarding out-of-bounds checking
	a bit stronger (new failures fixed in CharEnumerator.cs).

2002-03-06  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* ArrayTest.cs (TestSetValue4): Added testcases #M94-#M96 for Array.Copy.

	* ArrayTest.cs (TestCopyTo): Added testcases #F10-#F13 for arrays with
	non-zero lower bounds.

	* ArrayTest.cs (TestCopyTo): Added test for copying an empty array
	to an empty array.

2002-03-06  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Use unique labels for all the tests.
	(TestSetValue4): A big new testcase.

2002-03-06  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* VersionTest.cs: Fix for mscorlib behavior vs. docs. CompareTo(null)
	is legal.
	* UInt16Test.cs:
	* UInt32Test.cs:
	* UInt64Test.cs: Use NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo.CurrencySymbol
	where "$" was used. Should help suppress false negatives on systems
	where "$" is not the currency symbol.

2002-03-04  Duco Fijma  <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* VersionTest.cs: created test cases for System.Version

2002-03-03  Duco Fijma  <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* CharEnumeratorTest.cs: completed the test cases

2002-03-03  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DateTimeTest.cs: make static member non-static -- wouldn't work on 
	Windows if it was static. Doesn't _need_ to be static anyway.

2002-03-01  Duco Fijma  <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* AttributeTest.cs: created, far from complete. 
	* CharEnumeratorTest.cs: created. Contains just the basic case.
	* AllTests.cs: added the two new tests above

2002-03-01  Duco Fijma  <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* BitConverterTest.cs: added one test for bug fix made to BitConverter
	* class.

2002-03-01  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Commented out a few bits which are not yet implemented and
	marked them with FIXME's.

	* DecimalTest.cs, DecimalTest2.cs: Added zero-arg constructors.

	* MartinTests.cs: Enabled ArrayTests.cs.

2002-03-01  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>

	* BitConverterTest.cs: completed test cases

2002-03-01  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MartinTests.cs: 15 tests currently work on Linux, call them all and
	provide comments for the non-working tests.

2002-02-28  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* MathTest.cs: Committed for Jon Guymon <gnarg@slackworks.com>.

2002-02-28  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* String.cs (TestCompare): Added a few tests.
	(TestFormat): Please don't compare two strings with Assert (... == ...),
	use AssertEquals instead - this gives you a better idea what went wrong
	if the test fails.

2002-02-28  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* BitConverterTest.cs: Test was trying to catch the wrong Exception.
	The MSDN docs clearly say ArgumentOutOfRangeException, but that's
	not what get's thrown.

	* DoubleTest.cs: Get working against mscorlib reference.

2002-02-27  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* GuidTest.cs: changed to reflect new meaning of Guid.ToString("")
	and Guid.ToString(null)

2002-02-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MartinTests.cs: New file. This contains all the test which already
	work on Linux.

	* String.cs: Added two testcases to TestTrim(), TestTrimStart() and
	TestTrimEnd().

2002-02-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* DateTimeTest.cs: Added testcases for the parsers. Use the invariant
	culture to run this test suite.

	* TimeZoneTest.cs: Use the invariant culture to run this test suite.

2002-02-26  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all>
	* TimeSpanTest.cs: added test from TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds

2002-02-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* DateTimeTest.cs: New test.

	* TimeZoneTest.cs: New test.

2002-02-25  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* GuidTest.cs: all methods of System.Guid are now covered
	* BitConverterTest.cs: created, not yet complete

2002-02-21  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* GuidTest.cs: changed according to fix in System.Guid

2002-02-20  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* Int64Test.cs: One array was giving us trouble.  Not sure why, but
	it's related to the number of elements in an Array.  For short Arrays
	the compiler doesn't use the PrivateImplmentationDetails struct,
	but for longer ones it does.  That's when our corlib fails. I paired
	down the array for now.

2002-02-19  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* GuidTest.cs: added a few cases

2002-02-18  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* GuidTest.cs: Fix compile error.  Needed to cast the null in the call to
	constructor to avoid ambiguity.

2002-02-11  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* Int64Test.cs: Various fixes to make tests work against the ms corlib.
	Currency Symbol tests seem to be system dependant.  Not sure if this
	will work on other systems, so please test it if you can. The most
	disturbing one is negative numbers.  Should they be (n) or -n ?

2002-02-10  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* AllTests.cs: Add Int64Test to the Suite
	* Int64Test.cs: Change static member to instance member. This was
	causing NUnitConsole some grief.  Should be instance member anyway.

2002-02-09  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ByteTest.cs:
	* Int16Test.cs:
	* Int32Test.cs:
	* SByteTest.cs:
	* UInt16Test.cs:
	* UInt32Test.cs:
	* UInt64Test.cs: Fixed tests where a "$" was hard coded.  Change it to
	use NumberFormatInfo.CurrentInfo.CurrencySymbol.  Also used
	NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo.CurrencySymbol where appropriate. These
	tests all pass now with mscorlib.

2002-01-06  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ResolveEventArgsTest.cs: New test.
	* AllTests.cs: Added new test to suite.

2001-12-27  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* UInt32Test.cs: Added messages to Asserts()'s to find out which one was faliing.

2001-12-21  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* UInt32Test.cs: Added tests for UInt32.Parse.

	* Int32Test.cs: Added tests for Int32.Parse for various cases.

2001-12-08  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ByteTest.cs: Added messages to Assert()'s to find out which one was failing.

2001-11-28  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* Int16Test.cs Int32Test.cs SByteTest.cs: Surgically removed tests that rely on culture of system.  These need to be crafted a bit differently.

2001-11-27  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* SByteTest.cs: Add messages to Assert()'s so we can tell where the tests fail.

2002-02-21  Bob Doan  <bdoan@sicompos.com>

	* BooleanTest.cs: Added New test suite
	* AllTests.cs: Added new Boolean test to suite.

2002-02-24  Bob Doan  <bdoan@sicompos.com>

	* BooleanTest.cs: Use correct argument order in AssertEquals
	* AllTests.cs: Added new Double test to suite.
	* DoubleTest.cs: Add new test suite

2002-02-24  Bob Doan  <bdoan@sicompos.com>

	* DoubleTest.cs: Added parse tests to Double test suite, removed GetHashCodeTests
