	* Int64Test.cs: One array was giving us trouble.  Not sure why, but
	it's related to the number of elements in an Array.  For short Arrays
	the compiler doesn't use the PrivateImplmentationDetails struct,
	but for longer ones it does.  That's when our corlib fails. I paired
	down the array for now.

	* GuidTest.cs: added a few cases

	* GuidTest.cs: Fix compile error.  Needed to cast the null in the call to
	constructor to avoid ambiguity.

	* Int64Test.cs: Various fixes to make tests work against the ms corlib.
	Currency Symbol tests seem to be system dependant.  Not sure if this
	will work on other systems, so please test it if you can. The most
	disturbing one is negative numbers.  Should they be (n) or -n ?

	* AllTests.cs: Add Int64Test to the Suite
	* Int64Test.cs: Change static member to instance member. This was
	causing NUnitConsole some grief.  Should be instance member anyway.

	* ByteTest.cs:
	* Int16Test.cs:
	* Int32Test.cs:
	* SByteTest.cs:
	* UInt16Test.cs:
	* UInt32Test.cs:
	* UInt64Test.cs: Fixed tests where a "$" was hard coded.  Change it to
	use NumberFormatInfo.CurrentInfo.CurrencySymbol.  Also used
	NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo.CurrencySymbol where appropriate. These
	tests all pass now with mscorlib.

	* ResolveEventArgsTest.cs: New test.
	* AllTests.cs: Added new test to suite.

	* UInt32Test.cs: Added messages to Asserts()'s to find out which one was faliing.

2001-12-21  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* UInt32Test.cs: Added tests for UInt32.Parse.

	* Int32Test.cs: Added tests for Int32.Parse for various cases.

2001-12-08  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ByteTest.cs: Added messages to Assert()'s to find out which one was failing.

	* Int16Test.cs Int32Test.cs SByteTest.cs: Surgically removed tests that rely on culture of system.  These need to be crafted a bit differently.

2001-11-27  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* SByteTest.cs: Add messages to Assert()'s so we can tell where the tests fail.
