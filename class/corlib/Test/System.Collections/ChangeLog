	* HashtableTest.cs: make the second test class public.  The was showing
	as an error whe run against the mscorlib.  Might be because of the
	new NUnit that was just checked in.

	* ArrayListTest.cs: Add a small assert for a bug that I found and fixed
	in ArrayList.  Make sure it doesn't come up again.

	* StackTest.cs: Removed test for IsReadonly.  Doesn't exist in .NET 1.0

	* BitArrayTest.cs: wrapped try-catch blocks around several of the tests. 
	NUnit doesn't properly catch exception here anymore.  Must be something
	to do with upgrading to .NET.1.0.
