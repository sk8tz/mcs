	* ArrayListTest.cs (TestTrimToSize): Change test so that it doesn't
	rely on the specific timing of a capacity change.  Our corlib doubles
	capacity sooner than the reference system does.

	* HashtableTest.cs: make the second test class public.  The was showing
	as an error whe run against the mscorlib.  Might be because of the
	new NUnit that was just checked in.

2002-02-20  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ArrayListTest.cs: Add a small assert for a bug that I found and fixed
	in ArrayList.  Make sure it doesn't come up again.

	* QueueTest.cs: Put in correct namespace.

2002-01-20  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* BitArrayTest.cs: wrapped try-catch blocks around several of the tests. 
	NUnit doesn't properly catch exception here anymore.  Must be something
	to do with upgrading to .NET.1.0.
