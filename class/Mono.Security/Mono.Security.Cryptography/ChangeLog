	* KeyPairPersistance.cs: Provides a similar to CryptoAPI persistence 
	mechanism for keypairs (based on CspParameters).

	* CryptoConvert.cs: RSA doesn't start with a Q - at least that what
	a strongname told me. Sorry Ron :(

	* MD4.cs: New. Asbtract class for all MD4 implementations. WARNING:
	The MD4 algorithm is BROKEN (collisions) and SHOULDN'T be used in 
	NEW designs. However some higher level algorithms (like NTLM) requires 
	MD4 (and may even be secure using it). YOU'RE WARNED!
	* MD4Managed.cs: New. Managed implementation of MD4 (RFC1320).
	* PKCS8.cs: New. Added Private-Key Information Syntax Standard as a 
	building block for PKCS12.

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Fixed strongname generation for small exponents 
	(like 17). Part of the fixed for bug #50341.

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Work around for mcs? bug 45127.

	* ARC4Managed.cs: New. Implementation of the Alleged RC4(tm)
	stream cipher in managed code (required for SSL/TLS).
	* CryptoConvert.cs: New. Helper class to help convert between
	Windows crypto structures and .NET crypto classes (required
	for security tools).
	* MD2.cs: New. Abstract class for all MD2 hash implementations.
	* MD2Managed.cs: New. Managed implementation of the MD2 hash
	algorithm (required for old, but still valid, X.509 certificates).
	* RC4.cs: New. Abstract class for all RC4 stream cipher 
	implementations.
