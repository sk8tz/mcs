	* PKCS12.cs: Fixed sequence problem in Pkcs8ShroudedKeyBag. Fixed key
	bag implementation in GetBytes. Moved key bag implementation in 
	GetBytes to fit OpenSSL. Added NULL digest in MAC (GetBytes) to fit
	OpenSSL. Added SaveToFile method.

	* PKCS12.cs: Completed GetBytes() so it	is now possible to encode
	/ encrypt PKCS12 files.

	* X509Store.cs: Changed not to use base64 in filenames as it can 
	conflict with path separators. Now use plain hex. Now catch
	incorrectly encoded certificates / CRL in stores. Added Name property.

2004-02-24  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* X509Certificate.cs: Add support for the OID "1.3.14.3.2.29" (SHA1 
	with RSA). Added a fix for "really" null algorithm parameters.
	* X509CertificateCollection.cs: Fixed Contains and IndexOf (worked
	on objects but not for the same certificate in a different object).

	* TestAnchors.cs: Removed - no need to be hardcoded anymore.
	* X509Chain.cs: Updated to use the new store for trusted roots.
	* X509CRL.cs: New. Certificate Revocation List v1/v2 support.
	* X509Store.cs: New. Managed each individual store (with or
	without CRL support).
	* X509StoreManager.cs: New. Certificate Store Manager to access
	user and machine stores and to merge them when required.
	* X509Stores.cs: New. Certificate stores group for either the
	current user or the local machine.

2004-02-20  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* X509Chain.cs: Added an option to use a pre-built chain (like TLS
	offers) to save time rebuilding it. Added some validations and more
	detailled status. Still a LOT to do!
	* X509ChainStatusFlags.cs: New. Status code for the results of the
	chain building and verification.

	* ITrustAnchors.cs: New. Interface to trust anchors.
	* TestAnchors.cs: New. Include 2 tests anchors: Microsoft Root Agency
	(for Windows compatibility) and Mono Test Root.
	* TrustAnchors.cs: New. Include some widely used (commercial) code 
	signing root certificates.
	* X509CertificateCollection.cs: New. Collection for Mono's X509 
	certificates.
	* X509Chain.cs: New. MINIMAL certificate chaining engine to support
	Authenticode(tm). VERY PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION!!!

	certificates.
	* X509CertificateBuilder.cs: New. Class to build X.509 certificates.
