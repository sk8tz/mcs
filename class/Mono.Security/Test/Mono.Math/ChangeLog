	* BigIntegerTest.cs: Added tests for ModPow when power is 0, for a 
	known case that was faling in classpath and when modulo is a power of
	two (bug #70169).

2004-10-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* BigIntegerTest.cs: New. General unit tests for BigInteger.

2004-04-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* GcdBigTest.cs: Ajusted to changes in assembly.
	* ModInverseBigTest.cs: Ajusted to changes in assembly.
	* PrimeGenerationTest.cs: Ajusted to changes in assembly.
	* PrimeTestingTest.cs: Ajusted to changes in assembly.
	* SearchGeneratorTest.cs: Ajusted to changes in assembly.

	* PrimeTestingTest.cs: Added well known (and tested) primes from 
	RFC 2412 (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2412.html) as suggested by
	Pieter Philippaerts (#51229).
	* SearchGeneratorTest.cs: Modified so this still use the (previous)
	SmallPrimeSppTest primality test - because RM doesn't work for
	small primes.
