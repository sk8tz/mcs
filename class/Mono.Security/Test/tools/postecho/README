POSTECHO

To run the postecho tool your web server must have a script present to return
the TEST variable value to the tool.

The tool can use the HttpWebRequest|Response or the SslClientStream directly.
This is almost identical when executed on Mono but very different if you test
with the MS runtime.


Available server-side scripts

1.	sendback.asp

	ASP* script to return back the TEST value.


[*] This ISN'T an ASP.NET script as I didn't have it IIS present when 
installing VS.NET.
