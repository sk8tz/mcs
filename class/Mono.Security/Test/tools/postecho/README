POSTECHO

To run the postecho tool your web server must have a script present to return
the TEST variable value to the tool.

The tool can use the HttpWebRequest|Response or the SslClientStream directly.
This is almost identical when executed on Mono but very different (execution
wise not result wise) if you test with the MS runtime.


Available server-side scripts

1.	sendback.asp

	ASP script to return back the TEST value.

2.	sendback.aspx

	ASP.NET script to return back the TEST value.
