	* TlsClientCertificate.cs: Use Negotiating.Cipher instead of Cipher.
	Fix reading the message length if it's zero (in that case it's not 
	present two times).
	* TlsClientFinished.cs: Use Current.Cipher instead of Cipher. Use 
	Compare to test client and server digests equality.
	* TlsClientHello.cs: Use Negotiating.Cipher instead of Cipher.
	* TlsClientKeyExchange.cs: Use Negotiating.Cipher instead of Cipher.
	* TlsServerFinished.cs: Use Current.Cipher instead of Cipher.
	* TlsServerHello.cs: Use Negotiating.Cipher instead of Cipher.

	* TlsClientCertificate.cs: Fix decoding (extra length) and for null
	 (no certificates). Add basic client certificate validations before
	calling the callback (which can override the default decision).
	* TlsClientCertificateVerify.cs: Fix signature verification (the first
	two bytes are the length of the signature).
	* TlsServerCertificateRequest.cs: Sent the list of trusted root DNs.

	* TlsClientFinished.cs: ProcessAsTls1 - get out of the loop if PRF are
	different.

	* TlsClientKeyExchange.cs: Removed .Clear call on private key as itn't
	ours (but only a reference). It also requires the callback to recreate
	a new key object each time (which is worse). This also implies that 
	the caller (implementing the callback) is responsible to clear it.
