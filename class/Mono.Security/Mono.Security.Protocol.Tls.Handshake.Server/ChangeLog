	* TlsClientFinished.cs: ProcessAsTls1 - get out of the loop if PRF are
	different.

	* TlsClientKeyExchange.cs: Removed .Clear call on private key as itn't
	ours (but only a reference). It also requires the callback to recreate
	a new key object each time (which is worse). This also implies that 
	the caller (implementing the callback) is responsible to clear it.
