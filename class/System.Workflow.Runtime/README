Welcome to Windows Workflow Foundation Mono implementation

* Introduction

Windows Workflow Foundation (WWF) has been introduced as part of Microsoft .Net 3.0 framework (also called WinFX). It is a namespace and a set of tools designed
for building workflow enabled applications on .Net.

The WWF is implemented using three assemblies: System.Workflow.Activities, System.Workflow.ComponentModel and System.Workflow.Runtime.

* Status

This library is in pre-alpha state. Development is still in the very early stages. Bug reports are welcome, provided they don't just point out missing
classes. Please use http://bugzilla.ximian.com/.

* Contributions

Some indications when contributing to this namespace:

- Contributions providing only stubs are not useful at this point. Our goal is to have a consistent and complete working implementation. New classes, enumerator
or interfaces should be defined as they are need it as progress is made in the implementation.

- For every new class or behavior added to a class provide a clear test case to verify its functionality and it to the test case suite for the assembly.

- Before committing a change or propose a patch please verify that it does not break any existing test case for any of the three assemblies used to implement
WWF.

- Check the 'CodingStyle' file at mcs/CodingStyle

* Install

In order to install WWF you should compile the assemblies using 'make PROFILE=net_2_0 install' in the following order:

- System.Workflow.ComponentModel
- System.Workflow.Activities
- System.Workflow.Runtime
- System.Workflow.ComponentModel (twice, due to cyclic dependencies)

At System.Workflow.Runtime/Samples you have some examples to demonstrate some basic functionality.
