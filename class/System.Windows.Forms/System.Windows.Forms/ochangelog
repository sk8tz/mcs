2002-9-3   John Sohn <jsohn@columbus.rr.com>
	* Control.cs: mapped more of the functions to the Win32 API
	* Win32.cs: added more Win32 imports and definitions
	
2002-9-1   John Sohn <jsohn@columbus.rr.com>
	* MessageBox.cs: added mostly complete implementation of the 
	MessageBox class
	* Application.cs: completed implementation of Run methods, implemented
	message handler functionality
	* Form.cs: implemented the Close event, allows the Application class to
	receive notification for shutting down the application
	* FormTest.cs: added additional functionality to test most methods
	currently implemented in the Application and Form class
	* NativeWindowTest.cs: fixed methods which received the MSG structure,
	previously was using an integer type instead of the struct
	* Win32.cs: added more Win32 imports and definitions
	* makefile: added the MessageBox.cs class to the build

2002-8-30  John Sohn <jsohn@columbus.rr.com>
	* Application.cs: removed _ApplicationWndProc, we no longer need to 
	have the WndProc callback in the stub application
	* Control.cs: use new registered class, implemented WndProc 
	functionality
	* NativeWindow.cs: Now using the WndProc handler again. The window 
	class is now registered in C# code instead of the helper function
	in the stub shared library.
	* NativeWindowTest.cs: using the new registered class
	* Win32.cs: added more Win32 definitions, added DllImport and helper
	function in stub application to register the window class.
	* monostart.c: no longer being used, tagged for deletion. no longer
	registering the class and WNDPROC inside the stub application
	* monostub.c: Simplified the stub application and am now registering
	the window class and WNDPROC callback in C# code. This is now the only 
	file that is used in the stub application. In order to simplify the 
	code the #include <windows.h> was removed due to overlap with the 
	jit.h include file but some definitions from windows.h are included
	in this file. WinMain and MonoRegisterClass are the only functions
	that exist in this file and application.
	* makefile: removed monostart.c from the build, added Test.exe to 
	the build

	System.Windows.Forms, and test applications. Based on the makefile 
	used in the Gtk target of Windows.Forms. The build.sh script is
	no longer maintained.
