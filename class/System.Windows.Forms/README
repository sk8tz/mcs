* Introduction

	Welcome to the System.Windows.Forms implementation for Mono.
	
	This is still an early version of the class library.  The
	plans for this library have changed, the plans to use multiple
	backends is no longer being pursued.
	
	We are now implementing this using the Wine as library (because
	Windows.Forms applications require the message handling to be
	compatible with Windows, look up the Control.Wndproc method
	for details).
	
	To run and execute with the Mono runtime on linux, the story
	is more complicated as we need to use the "WineLib" support in
	Wine.

* The Layout

	The layout in this directory has some historical files that you can
	safely ignore, the following are just historical directories:

		Gtk/
		WINElib/

	All of the real code is being done in the same was as it is being done
	in the rest of the Mono assemblies.

* To run Windows.Forms Applications

	You must install the `winelib' module which is a couple of
	libraries that are added to an existing Wine installation.
