System.Windows.Forms wine-patch README

After applying the patch to wine, run "autoconf configure.ac" and then 
./configure in the wine directory and 'make && make depend && make install'.

For now the patch assumes that the prefix_dir is /usr/local.

Also, once the install is done you will need to create symbolic links for
all the dlls you plan on using in System.Windows.Forms:

cd /usr/local/lib
for i in wine/*dll.so; do ln -s $i lib$i; done

I still need to work out how to teach mono to load the libs from the wine 
directory and without the lib prefix.
