	cairo-api.cs: drawble -> drawable typo

2003-08-24  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com> 		

	* cairo-api.cs: New file, replace Cairo.cs and cairo.cs. That
	naming thing is just too confusing.

	* Cairo.cs: Make all references to the enums (Cairo.Foo) be just
	Foo. This should (hopefully) fix the build on Windows.

	Initial checkin of System.Drawing.XrImpl ported to use Cairo.

	* Graphics.cs (DrawCurve):
	(DrawImageUnscaled): 
	(IsVisible):Implement the overloads in terms of the other overloads.

	(FillClosedCurve): Implement the simple APIs, the default tension
	is 0.5, the default FillMode is FillMode.Alternate.

	* cairo.cs: A copy of the CairoAPI class from the Mono.Cairo
	assembly, with some method parameter/return type changed to better
	fit the usage within System.Drawing.

	* gdk-helpers.cs: Emulate some of Gdk.Pixbuf's API here,
	basically the same as XrImpl's GDKfunctions.cs, but the names of
	the functions are nicer, with the help of the DllImportAttribute's
	EntryPoint field.
