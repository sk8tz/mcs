	* Pen.cs: Add Clone method.

	* gdk-helpers.cs: Remember to call gdk_init before hand.
	(gdk_pixbuf_finalize): Removed, as it is no longer available
	in the current API.
	(Helpers): New class to contain other misc. helper functions.
	(Init): Import gdk_init.
	(Unref): Import g_object_unref. This should be used in place of
	gdk_pixbuf_finalize.
	
	* cairo-api.cs: Updated to reflect recent API changes.
	(cairo_copy): New API.
	(cairo_surface_put_image): Removed to keep updated with current
	API.
	(cairo_current_foo): Renamed from the old cairo_get_foo methods.

	cairo-api.cs: typos: drawble -> drawable, tolerence -> tolerance

	* cairo-api.cs: New file, replace Cairo.cs and cairo.cs. That
	naming thing is just too confusing.

	* Cairo.cs: Make all references to the enums (Cairo.Foo) be just
	Foo. This should (hopefully) fix the build on Windows.

	Initial checkin of System.Drawing.XrImpl ported to use Cairo.

	* Graphics.cs (DrawCurve):
	(DrawImageUnscaled): 
	(IsVisible):Implement the overloads in terms of the other overloads.

	(FillClosedCurve): Implement the simple APIs, the default tension
	is 0.5, the default FillMode is FillMode.Alternate.

	* cairo.cs: A copy of the CairoAPI class from the Mono.Cairo
	assembly, with some method parameter/return type changed to better
	fit the usage within System.Drawing.

	* gdk-helpers.cs: Emulate some of Gdk.Pixbuf's API here,
	basically the same as XrImpl's GDKfunctions.cs, but the names of
	the functions are nicer, with the help of the DllImportAttribute's
	EntryPoint field.
