On how to fill out the CultureInfo XML files

For all the files:

    * We need translation for the name of each culture. Given a
      CultureInfo code, we'd like to know its DisplayName, EnglishName
      and NativeName.

      DisplayName - This is the full name of this language used in
      this culture. The format for this string should be:

           [Full language name] ([Country name] / [Region name])

      EnglishName - This string is the same as DisplayName, but it
      must be in English.

      NativeName - This string is the same as DisplayName, but it is
      in the language of this specific culture. For example, for 'de',
      the NativeName should be 'Deutsch'.

    * We need to fill in possible Calendars that can be used in this
      Culture. If alternative calendars are used in this culture, an
      element should be added to the sequence in
      OptionalCalendars. The string inside each additional element
      should be the full name of a class in the System.Globalization
      namespace, and this class must be a decendant of the
      System.Globalization.Calendar class.

For specific cultures:

    These are the files that are in the form ??-??.xml (excluding
    zh-CHS.xml and zh-CHT.xml). These files describe a culture /
    language that is specific to a single location. For example, while
    'fr' is the code for 'French' in general; 'fr-FR' is the code for
    French used in France specifically.

    For these cultures, we need the following items:

        - NumberFormatInfo

        - DateTimeFormatInfo

The format of DateTimeFormatInfo:

    The DateTimeFormatInfo section consists of 21 parts:

    Patterns:

                   this class must be a decendant of the
                   System.Globalization.Calendar class.

    17. CalendarWeekRule - The rule that specifies the first week of
                           the year. This string must conform to the
                           names set out by the

                        year, the month and the day.

    19. FirstDayOfWeek - The first day of the week. This string must
