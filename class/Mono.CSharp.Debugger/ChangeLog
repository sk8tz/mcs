	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Added support for method parameters.

2002-03-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (IMonoSymbolWriter): Removed my custom OpenMethod(),
	we're now using the ISymbolWriter's method.
	(IVariable): Added `byte[] Signature' property.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (SetAssembly): New method. This must be called before
	Close(); the assembly parameter is the already-written assembly, ie. it must
	contain the full metadata.
	(OpenMethod): Only take the token argument and set MethodInfo later in DoFixups.
	(SetMethodSourceRange): You must call this function to tell the symbol writer
	in which source file the method is defined.
	(DefineLocal): Store the signature in the local.
	(DoFixups): Use two new interncalls to set the SourceMethod's MethodInfo field
	and the LocalVariable's Type field.

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (ISourceBlock): New interface.
	(ILocalVariable): Renamed this interface to IVariable.
	(IVariable): Added Line, Type, Token.
	(ILocalVariable, IMethodParameter): New interfaces, derive from IVariable.
	(ISourceMethod): Added Blocks. Renamed FirstLine and LastLine to Start and End,
	changed their type to ISourceLine. Removed CodeSize.
	(ISourceLine): Renamed Line to Row, added Column. Added OffsetType and Offset.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (MonoDwarfFileWriter.DieLexicalBlock): New class.
	(MonoDwarfFileWriter.DieMethodVariable): New class.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (OpenScope, CloseScope): Implemented.
	Reflected latest IMonoSymbolWriter interface changes.

	* IAssemblerWriter.cs: New interface.

	* AssemblerWriterI386.cs: New class.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Use the IAssemblerWriter interface to make this class
	platform and assembler independent.

	This is an implementation of the System.Diagnostics.SymbolStore.SymbolWriter
	interface. It's still work in progress and not yet used anywhere.

	There is some preliminary documentation in the source files and some more
	docu in the README and README.relocation-table files.

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs: New file.
	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: New file.
