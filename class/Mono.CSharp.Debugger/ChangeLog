2002-06-29  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs, MonoSymbolWriter.cs: Put all TAG_subprogram's into their
	corresponding struct/class declarations.

2002-06-28  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* gdb-csharp-support.patch: Updated.

2002-06-28  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Use a TAG_string_type when we're using GNU extensions.
	Make static struct/class fields actually work.  Provide a TAG_typedef for struct's
	and classes.

2002-05-30  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter (IMonoSymbolWriter): Added custom `Initialize' method.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (Initialize): The ISymbolWriter's `Initialize' method
	is no longer supported and throws an exception.
	(Initialize (string, string[])): New custom initialization function.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (DwarfFileWriter): Added `string[] args' argument
	to the constructor to pass command line arguments.

	* gdb-csharp-support.patch: Updated for GDB 5.2.

2002-05-30  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (MonoSymbolWriter): The constructor now get's the
	AssemblyBuilder's `methods' array as third argument.
	(OpenMethod): Use this array to get the method builder rather than using an
	interncall for it.
	(get_method_builder): Removed this interncall.

2002-05-25  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Finished the type rewrite, put back strings and arrays.

2002-05-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (ISourceMethod): Added `FullName' and `Parameters'.
	(ITypeHandle): New interface.

	* DwarfFileWriter.cs: Largely reorganized the type writing code.  Types are
	now represented by ITypeHandle objects which are stored in a per-dwarf-writer
	hash table.  At the moment, all types still need to be in one compile unit due
	to lacking support in gdb - but this new type code here already supports this.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs: Moved all the subclasses to the top-level and made them
	public, cleaned up the code, put everything into one compile unit.
	(DefineLocalVariable): Added a version of this function which takes useful args.

2002-05-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (IMonoSymbolWriter): Added `Sources' and `Methods'
	properties.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (WriteSymbolTable): New public method.  Moved the
	code that writes the "mono_line_numbers" section here from the LineNumberEngine.

2002-05-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (IVariable): Replaced Token with `ISourceMethod Method'.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (MonoSymbolWriter): The constructor now has an additional
	ModuleBuilder argument.
	(OpenMethod): Immediately call the `get_method' interncall to get the MethodBase
	from the token, then store the MethodBase instead of the token.  The token may
	still change during the metadata library's fixup process.
	(DoFixups): When the image has been written to disk, call the GetToken () method
	on all MethodBuilders and all ConstructorBuilders to get the final metadata tokens.

2002-05-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* AssemblerWriterI386.cs: Don't use GNU extensions and produce assembler
	output which is free of comments and extra whitespaces so that it's suitable
	for `as -f'.

2002-05-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (ISourceMethod): Replaced `MethodInfo MethodInfo' with
	`MethodBase MethodBase' and added `Type ReturnType'.  We're now correctly
	dealing with constructors and not crashing anymore.

2002-05-21  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Write a special line number table which can be read
	in by the metadata library to get line number information in backtraces.

2002-05-06  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (MonoSymbolWriter.Close): Use Assembly.LoadFrom (), not
	AppDomain.Load () to load the assembly.

2002-04-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* gdb-csharp-support.patch: A patch for GDB (against the latest CVS version)
	to implement C# support.

	* csharp-lang.c, csharp-lang.h, csharp-mono-lang.c: Copy these into your GDB
	source directory after applying the patch.

2002-04-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (DieInternalString): Removed.

2002-04-25  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Reflect latest MonoString changes.

2002-04-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (ISourceBlock): Added `Blocks' property and `AddBlock'
	method to support nested blocks.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs: Correctly handle nested blocks.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (DieMember): Provide info for all fields, not just for
	public ones; also added DW_AT_accessibility.
	(DieVariable): Reflected latest debug-symfile.c changes.

2002-04-12  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* gdb-variable-scopes.patch: A patch for GDB (against the latest CVS version)
	to implement variable lifetimes.

2002-04-12  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (DieVariable): Provide info about the variable's
	lifetime using DW_AT_begin_scope and a new baulig extension DW_AT_end_scope.

2002-03-29  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* AssemblerWriterI386.cs: Rewrote most of the string output function, do the
	number->string conversion manually. It's now taking about 15 seconds to write
	a symbol file for MCS, no longer more than a minute.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Added some profiling code, speeded things up, fixed
	a few bugs.

2002-03-25  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (CreateType): Return a `DieType'.
	(RegisterType): Add the type to the type hash before creating dependency types
	so we don't get recursion loops.
	(RegisterPointerType): New func to register a "pointer to type" type.
	(DieTypeDef, DiePointerType, DieArrayType, DieStringType, DieClassType): New
	types; added support for strings, arrays and basic support for classes.
	
2002-03-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs: Killed all methods in this interface, no longer needed.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (MonoSymbolWriter): The constructor now takes a string
	argument which is the full pathname of the assembly - you must call Close()
	after the assembly has been written to disk since the symbol writer needs to
	load the finished assembly to get its metadata.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Added support for enums and structs.
	
2002-03-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Added support for method parameters.

2002-03-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (IMonoSymbolWriter): Removed my custom OpenMethod(),
	we're now using the ISymbolWriter's method.
	(IVariable): Added `byte[] Signature' property.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (SetAssembly): New method. This must be called before
	Close(); the assembly parameter is the already-written assembly, ie. it must
	contain the full metadata.
	(OpenMethod): Only take the token argument and set MethodInfo later in DoFixups.
	(SetMethodSourceRange): You must call this function to tell the symbol writer
	in which source file the method is defined.
	(DefineLocal): Store the signature in the local.
	(DoFixups): Use two new interncalls to set the SourceMethod's MethodInfo field
	and the LocalVariable's Type field.

2002-03-23  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (ISourceBlock): New interface.
	(ILocalVariable): Renamed this interface to IVariable.
	(IVariable): Added Line, Type, Token.
	(ILocalVariable, IMethodParameter): New interfaces, derive from IVariable.
	(ISourceMethod): Added Blocks. Renamed FirstLine and LastLine to Start and End,
	changed their type to ISourceLine. Removed CodeSize.
	(ISourceLine): Renamed Line to Row, added Column. Added OffsetType and Offset.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (MonoDwarfFileWriter.DieLexicalBlock): New class.
	(MonoDwarfFileWriter.DieMethodVariable): New class.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (OpenScope, CloseScope): Implemented.
	Reflected latest IMonoSymbolWriter interface changes.

2002-03-20  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IAssemblerWriter.cs: New interface.

	* AssemblerWriterI386.cs: New class.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Use the IAssemblerWriter interface to make this class
	platform and assembler independent.

2002-03-20  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (ISourceMethod): Added FirstLine, LastLine, CodeSize and
	Token properties.

	New interfaces.

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (OpenMethod): Take a System.Reflection.MethodInfo, not
	a string.

2002-03-19  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	This is an implementation of the System.Diagnostics.SymbolStore.SymbolWriter
	interface. It's still work in progress and not yet used anywhere.

	docu in the README and README.relocation-table files.

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs: New file.
	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: New file.
