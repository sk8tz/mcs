	* Json.cs: added new Serialize overload which takes a TextWriter
	for its output parameter.
	Added Deserialize methods.

	* JsonSerializer.cs: made InitialJavaScriptDateTicks internal.
	Added new Serialize overload which takes a TextWriter for its
	output parameter.
	Added WriteValue overloads for float and double - they must not be
	converted to strings as IConvertibles because their Max/MinValue
	end up converted incorrectly.

	* JavaScriptSerializer.cs: adjustments for the new JSON
	(de)serializer.

	* JsonDeserializer.cs: new JSON deserializer code, fully compliant
	with the .NET AJAX one.
