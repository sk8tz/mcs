	* UpdatePanel.cs: do not check whether a panel whose children are
	to be rendered has been marked for update in the async postback
	mode. It prevents complex scenarios where there is one superior
	update panel which owns an inferior one, and only the superior one
	has Update called on it.

	* ScriptManager.cs: do not throw NREX when there are no profile or
	authentication service sections in the config files.

	* AsyncPostBackTrigger.cs: don't thrown an exception if EventName
	is null or empty and there is no DefaultEventAttribute attached to
	the control.

	* ScriptComponentDescriptor.cs: do not add the same
	entry twice to a dictionary.
