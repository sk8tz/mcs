	* ClientProxyHandler.cs: before generating the proxy check if the
	service type is decorated with the [ScriptService] custom
	attribute. Only such service types can be called from client
	JavaScript.

	* LogicalTypeInfo.cs: do not use
	LazyDictionary as enum serializer anymore.

	LazyDictionary as ProfileService serializer anymore.

	* RestHandler.cs: do not use
