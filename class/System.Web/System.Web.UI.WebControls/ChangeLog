2002-03-19      Gaurav Vaish <gvaish@iitk.ac.in>

2002-03-17      Gaurav Vaish <gvaish@iitk.ac.in>

	Finally, I have made it. Today I did a second build for the
	 System.Web assembly. It compiled 195 classes today.
	I am waiting eagerly for the runtime to come up so that the objects
	 may be tested to their last levels. Several of the methods are still
	 under the tag of "TODO" throwing NotImplementedException. Well, I
	 hope to remove them soon, but how far is this soon - even I don't
	 know, though I am happy to make the build a success even before
	 the vacations to come.

2002-03-07      Gaurav Vaish <gvaish@iitk.ac.in>

	Yesterday and today I tried to do some building of the aseembly,
	 but was dumped with uncoutably infinite errors. ;-)
	I have put the copies of the recent errors on my home page, want
	 to have a look at them? See:
	  http://mastergaurav.virtualave.net/mono/
	I don't know what to do with these errors. Oh! The buggy me! How
	 will I overcome myself. Hopefully, by when my vacations over, I
	 should have made a repository where the build will not fail.

2002-03-05      Gaurav Vaish <gvaish@iitk.ac.in>

	I am now going to do a build that will include the
	 System.Web.UI.WebControls namespace. Hoping that I will make it
	 soon. My exams are coming near and I have to pack up soon.


2002-03-04      Gaurav Vaish <gvaish@iitk.ac.in>

Comments:
	And with this, ie, today's work, all the objects mentioned in the
	namespace appear in the implementation. But it may not be worth
	trying to go for a build because of dependence of several of the
	internal methods that may clash with already available assembly
	System.Web.
	
	Also, the classes lack possible attributes, like those informing
	about child-controls etc. But I have to first create the attribute
	classes before I attach the attributes to the classes.

	* CustomValidator.cs          - Completed. In process realized that
	             I have to complete / rejuvinate BaseValidator class.
	* BaseValidator.cs            - Complete rejuvination. Completed 80%
	            of the job. All that is left is Render(HtmlTextWriter),
	            DetermineRenderUplevel(), RegisterValidatorCommonScript()
	            RegisterValidatorDeclaration()
	* DataGridPagerStyle.cs       - Completed. That adds one more missle
	            in my artillery.
	* DataKeyCollection.cs        - Completed. Petty small.
	* Repeater.cs                 - Work started off. This is a quite
	            heavy class. Hooh!
	* DataGridItemEventArgs.cs,
	* DataGridShortCommandEventArgs.cs,
	* DataListItemEventArgs.cs,
	* MonthChangedEventArgs.cs,
	* RepeaterItemEventArgs.cs,
	* ServerValidateEventArgs.cs,
	* DataGridPageChangedEventArgs.cs
	                              - Damn, I marked them "*", while they
	            did not exist.
	* Repeater.cs                 - Done all except for an undocumented
	            method CreateControlHierarchy(bool). Though the method
	            is quite clear by its name, but it will take some time
	            for me to come with some material to flush in.

2002-03-03      Gaurav Vaish <gvaish@iitk.ac.in>

	* SelectedDatesCollection.cs  - Completed.
	* PagedDataSource.cs          - Completed. Pathetically nice class.
	* RegularExpressionValidator.cs
	                              - Completed. Ridiculously small and
	            annoyinglyc crazy-driving class, basically the method
	            EvaluateIsValid().
	* RangeValidator.cs           - Completed.
	* DataGridColumn.cs           - Completed.
	* EditCommandColumn.cs        - All is complete except for the
	            InitializeCell(TableCell, int, ListItemType) method.
	* DataListItem.cs             - All done except for a longish method
	            RenderItem(HtmlTextWriter, bool, bool)

2002-03-02      Gaurav Vaish <gvaish@iitk.ac.in>

	* RepeaterItemCollection.cs   - Completed.
	            I love *Collection classes. I am planning to make a
	            program that will generate a *Collection class. It's so
	            simple and the same. ;-)
	* DataGridColumnCollection.cs - Completed.
	            ... except probably for *ColumnCollection classes, where
	            you have to put in some more effort. Still, these class
	            generation can be automated.
	* DataListItemCollection.cs   - Completed.
	            See, how easily, in less than a quarter of a minute, I
	            completed this class - manually. Copy-Paste/Cut-Replace.

2002-02-21      Gaurav Vaish <gvaish@iitk.ac.in>

	* DataGrid.cs                 - Following methods implemented:

	         Addded support for properties:
	           GridLines, HeaderStyle, HeaderTemplate, ItemStyle, ItemTemplate,
	           RepeatColumns, RepeatDirection, RepeatLayout, SelectedIndex,
	           SelectedItem, SelectedItemStyle, SelectedItemTemplate,

	           CreateItem(int, ListItemType, bool, object),
	           PrepareControlHierarchy(), InitializeItem(DataListItem)
	* ListBox.cs                  - Started working.
