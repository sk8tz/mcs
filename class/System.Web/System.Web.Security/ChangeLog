	I have planned to stop work for the time being. The reasons are
	 seemingly obvious. I have to go and read some theory and get the
	 philosophy and the procedure involved. I think there would deep
	 linkage with System.Web.Configuration namespace.

	What I have planned is to first come with some architecture over
	 which I will build some modules that will finally lead to code
	 generation. Hooh! A long way to go before I get sandwiched in the
	 exams that start next week.
