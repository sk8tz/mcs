	* CacheDependencyCas.cs: Under 1.x FAM also requires UnmanagedCode so 
	we must assert this too before creating instances. We also "hide" an
	error where the initialization throws a NullReferenceException on 1.x
	(as this has nothing to do with CAS).

	* CacheCas.cs: New. CAS unit tests for Cache. It turns out that 
	UnmanagedCode permission is also required (down-level).
	* CacheDependencyCas.cs: New. CAS unit tests for CacheDependency. It 
	turns out that FileIOPermission is also required (down-level) and that
	Mono (currently) requires Unmanaged permission for FAM.
