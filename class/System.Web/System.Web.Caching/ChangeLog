	* OutputCacheModule.cs: Store a CachedVaryBy object for each
	cached page. Then store a CachedRawResponse for each combination
	of varried parameters for a page.
	* CachedRawResponse.cs: Do not need to store param values anymore
	those are stored in the CachedVaryBy now. Get the content length
	so we dont send back the entire buffer.
	* CachedVaryBy.cs: New file - holds the varyby data for a page,
	and a method to generate a key based on params. Right now this
	only works with VaryByParams. TODO: support VaryByHeaders and
	VaryByCustom.

	* CachedRawResponse.cs: New file - A snapshot of a response that
	is stored in the cache and can be used to create a new response.
	* OutputCacheModule.cs: Module for inserting and retrieving
	responses from the cache.

	* Cache.cs:
	* CacheDefinitions.cs:
	* CacheDependency.cs:
	* CacheEntry.cs:
	* CacheExpires.cs:
	* ExpiresBuckets.cs: reformatted, make class status page happier. Does
	not work yet (wait for the next patch).

	* CacheEntry.cs: several changes. New constants, use of constants
	defined in Cache.cs, modified locks to optimize perf. Fixed property
	sets which weren't using the keyword value to set the new values
	(don't know how this worked before!).

	* Cache.cs: changed singleton implementation to only create the object
	when actually used. Changed Insert overloads to use constants
	defined instead of hard values.

	* ExpiresBuchets: major changes. All locking now uses ReaderWriterLock
	class. Bucket now efectively reuses free indexes from removed items
	to avoid unnecessary expansions. Expansion now uses Array.CopyTo to
	add elements to the new list. Added private Int32Collection to
	handle int indexes efficiently (thanks Shawn Van Ness). See comments
	there.
