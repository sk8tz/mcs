	* HtmlSelect.cs (TrackViewState): Added 'new' keyword to avoid
	clashing with the method defined in the parent class.
	(OnDataBinding): Added missing casts.

	* HtmlForm.cs (Render): Fixed call too SetAttribute, need to cast
	'this' to IAttributeAccessor before calling interface method.
	Also renamed some calls to reflect changes in the API.

	* HtmlControl.cs (WriteOnClickAttribute): Made it not static and
	fixed a typo.
