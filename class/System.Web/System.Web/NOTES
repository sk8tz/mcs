Session notes:
When a request is finished, the contents of Request.Session are serialized and dumped to the State Server.
When a request is started, a new Request.Session is created, data is deserialized from the State Server, and the objects are placed back into Request.Session.
The State Server is accessed via the SessionStateModule which is used for both session ID and state data management.
HttpApplicationState instance is created the first time a url within the applications virtual directory is accessed. Its accessable through HttpContext.Application.
HttpApplicationState needs to use lock/unlock explicitly.
Not shared across machines or multiple processes.
