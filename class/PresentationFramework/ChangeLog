	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs: some refactoring and
	improvements in error reporting
	* Test/XamlParser.cs: added a few tests and improved the readability

	scaffolding.

2005-07-17  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Test/XamlParser.cs: add a bunch of tests

2005-07-16  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Test/XamlParser.cs: fix a bug in property tests, add tests for
	dependency properties and complex objects as property values. Actually
	include file in svn, oops.

2005-07-15  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* System.Windows.Serialization/Mapper.cs: make assembly loading more
	resilient
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/ObjectWriter.cs: do conversions from
	strings and support dependency properties

2005-07-15  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: don't try to convert
	objects into their parent types.

2005-07-15  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: Better debugging
	information
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs: Better debugging
	information, consolidated push() code
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: inverted sourceType and
	destType in endPropertyObject
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs: changed parseElement so
	that it doesn't stuff up the stack on empty elements and replaced 
	an if statement spanning CurrentState with a case statement for 
	clarity

2005-07-14  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: Initial support for
	creating complex objects as values of properties

2005-07-13  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs: fixed bug in the code
	detecting that the file's contents must be finished, where it forbade
	whitespace after the XAML code

2005-07-11  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Makefile,
	  Test/XamlParser.cs: added a few tests
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs: fixed some bugs that the
	  new tests turned up

2005-07-08  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/ObjectWriter.cs: code to build objects at
	runtime from a xaml file. Current problems are with events and
	delegates (current behaviour is untested and possibly useless) and
	DependencyProperties (not implemented yet)

2005-07-08  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: removed TypeConverter
	  stuff from everything except CodeWriter. By using TypeDescriptor,
	  the generator doesn't need to be told about the converter and since
	  the framework will find it we don't have to search for it.

2005-07-08  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: support for x:Name
	  attributes and for considering Name properties to have the same
	  affect.

2005-07-06  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: cleaned up a little, added
	support for the `partial' class modifier

2005-07-06  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/Mapping.cs: removed in favour of
	System.Windows.Serialization/Mapper.cs
	* System.Windows.Serialization/Mapper.cs: Added because it is the
	microsoft-documented mapping API
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs: transition to the new
	mapper system, also some general converging on the name
	DependencyProperty throughout instead of ContextProperty or
	AttachedProperty.

2005-07-05  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: add support for attached
	  properties as attributes, supplementing the existing support for
	  attached properties as elements

2005-07-05  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: add support for delegate
	  properties and for events
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/Mapper.cs: tighten up types so that Type
	  and PropertyInfo are passed instead of strings

2005-07-03  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs: added support for Code
	elements, provide fully qualified name of type to attach to, skip
	xmns: attributes when processing, 
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs: added WriteCode member,
	ordered methods by type of thing dealt with
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: added support for Code
	elements, call empty constructor for objects, call TypeConverter
	almost correctly.

2005-07-03  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: use CodeDom to do code
	generation
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs:
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs:
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs: initial TypeConverter
	support

2005-07-02  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* whole folder: implementation of Xaml-related namespaces
