	output buffer is null. if not, copy the values to buffer and
	return the bytes actually read.

	fixes bug #72472.

	* ChangeLog: New.
	* OraclePermission.cs: Adapted to work for both Fx 1.1 and 2.0. Fx 1.1
	version isn't complete (as anyway it requires FullTrust on MS 
	implementation) but DO NOT throw exceptions (for the security engine).
	* OraclePermissionAttribute.cs: Implemented CreatePermission. Adapted
	to work for both Fx 1.1 and 2.0.
