Small XSLT test system::

This is a small standalone test system using OASIS XSLT test suite
(only Xalan tests as yet).
http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xslt

"make" will do what you need (downloading test archive, expanding,
compiling test runner.

"make run-test" will do the actual tests.

If you want to create reference output files by yourself, compile
prepare.cs and run it on Microsoft.NET (it requires cygwin).
