	* Makefile : made "make test" independent of "make" so that extraneous
	  archive extraction won't be run every time (for automated tests).

2004-01-20  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Added set of Post Schema Compilation Information tests, i.e.
	  xs-psci-compare.cs and psci-ms-all.zip.
	* Makefile: Added test-psci target.
	* README: Added notes on PSCI tests (however it is not for today's
	  implementation, but for the very near future with bunch of fixes)

	* xsdtest.cs : XmlReaders should be closed in case of errors.
