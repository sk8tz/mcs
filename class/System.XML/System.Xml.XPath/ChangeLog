	* XPathScanner.cs: Added new file. This class is supposed to be internal
	but that would make it impossible to test.

	* XPathNamespaceScope.cs:
	* XPathNodeType.cs:
	* XPathResultType.cs:
	* XmlDataType.cs:
	* XmlSortOrder.cs: Used EnumCheck and realigned elements to be compatible with MS
	implementation. XPathResultType is interesting as EnumCheck does
	not show the Navigator element, but shows the String element twice.

	* XmlDataType.cs, XmlSortOrder.cs, XPathNodeType.cs: Added files.
