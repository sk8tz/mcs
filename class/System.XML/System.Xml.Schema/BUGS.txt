Bugs in Implementation:

1. XmlSchema.Read Fails if there is a wrong value for a enum type. Eg form="none" will throw an exception.
   The only conformant solution to this is using our own Deserializer or parser.
2. Schema Compile ignores errors where a name or id (or any other attribute) is empty. Eg if a schama has name="",
   it will not throw an exception but will be silently ignored. Again the solution is to write own parser.
3. Not all Compile methods check for the Id attribute. Trivial but needs to be done.
4. Need to check if errorCount is calculted correctly, and all of the error() methods increase it.
