Bugs in Implementation:

1.
None of the XmlSchemaObjects except the XmlSchema populate XmlSerializerNamespaces.

2.
Non schema attributes are not being handled. Need an internal XmlAttribute constructor.
3.
Documentation and appInfo's Markup is not being read in the Read() Method.

4.
Handling of unique particle attribution of sequences is almost complete, 
but not perfect. Note that it is W3C specification that is so buggy. 
Basically there is neither formalization nor even normative definition 
about unique particle attribution. Appendix H tried to describe about 
that, but it is too incomplete.

5.
Currently ContentTypeParticle was not eliminated "pointless" (see 3.9.6 of
xml schema part 1) XmlSchemaChoice, like MS.NET. It causes incorrect DBR
validation.
