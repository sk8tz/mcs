	* XmlSchemaAnnotation.cs : It depended on incorrect ReadNode().

2003-02-19  Atsushi Enomoto  <ginga@kit.hi-ho.ne.jp>

	* XmlSchemaAnnotation.cs : expect the correct closing tag on <appinfo>
		and <documentation> elements. (patch by Peter Pentchev)
	* XmlSchemaObjectEnumerator.cs : cast properly to XmlSchemaObject 
		instead of XmlSchema. (patch by Peter Pentchev)

	* XmlSchemaException.cs: Partiall implement the ISerializable
	methods. It's not clear now SourceSchemaObject should be deserialized.

2002-07-22  Tim Coleman  <tim@timcoleman.com>
	* XmlSchema.cs: Removed isCompiled which is defined as internal
		in XmlSchemaObject.

	* XmlSchema: Started work on Validate methods

2002-06-18  Dwivedi, Ajay kumar <adwiv@yahoo.com>
	* XmlSchema: The Read and Write methods are no more [MonoTODO] :)
	
	* XmlSchemaAppInfo: Xml Markup is now being read.
	
	* XmlSchemaDocumentation: Xml Markup is now being read.

	* All: Unhandled attributes are being handled properly.
	       
	* All: Reordered the properties in all cs files to match with MS
	       Implementation. This was required since the order is importatnt
	       for the XmlSerializer.

	* General: Fixed a few more Bugs

2002-06-10  Dwivedi, Ajay kumar <adwiv@yahoo.com>
	* XmlSchemaReader: A Wrapper class around XmlReader with customized
	  methods to suit reading a schema.
	* General: Implemented Read() method for the schema. There are only
	  a few minor bugs remaining.

2002-05-25  Dwivedi, Ajay kumar <adwiv@yahoo.com>
	* BUGS.txt: New file to keep track of bugs

	* ALL: All classes are initialized exactly as in .NET except
	       1. inclusion of language attribute in schema
	       2. ComplexContent's Particle is initialized to null whereas .NET 
	          to some internal implementation. IMO Null is more appropriate

	* ALL: Changed the Compile methods to return the count of errors.

	* ALL: Complile methods are almost complete. Pass 1453 of 3061 tests.
	       This number should shoot up if we write a parser to read the
	       Schema instead of using reflection (which is slower too)

2002-05-04  Dwivedi, Ajay kumar <adwiv@yahoo.com>
	* XmlSchemaUtil.cs: New file added. 
	
	* Parser.cs: New file Added. Unused at the moment.

	* XmlSchemaObjectCollection: Fixed GetEnumerator
	
	* General: Preprocessing for Attributes and SimpleTypes completed.
