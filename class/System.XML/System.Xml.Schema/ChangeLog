	* BUGS.txt: New file to keep track of bugs

	* ALL: All classes are initialized exactly as in .NET except
	       1. inclusion of language attribute in schema
	       2. ComplexContent's Particle is initialized to null whereas .NET 
	          to some internal implementation. IMO Null is more appropriate

	* ALL: Changed the Compile methods to return the count of errors.

	* ALL: Complile methods are almost complete. Pass 1453 of 3061 tests.
	       This number should shoot up if we write a parser to read the
	       Schema instead of using reflection (which is slower too)
