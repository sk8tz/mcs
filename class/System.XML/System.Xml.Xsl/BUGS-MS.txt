This is MS.NET bug note. I confirmed them with version 1.1.

In this document I refer to OASIS test suite (by test case name).
It is located here:
http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/documents.php?wg_abbrev=xslt

No. 0001

	position() handling in predicates is incomplete. For example,
	see foo [position() mod 1 > 0] [position() > 3] [2] result 
	(match_match19, match_match22 and match_match26)

No. 0002
	Import precedence resolution on attribute sets are buggy if there are
	two imported stylesheets and both of them have identically-named
	attribute in the identically-named attribute sets. MS takes the one
	from the first stylesheet, but it must be the one from another.
	(attribset_attribset_45)

No. 0003
	http://www.w3.org/1999/11/REC-xslt-19991116-errata/ E26 says that
	attribute sets are combined before use-attribute-set is replaced with
	the actual attributes. MS does not conform to this requirement.
	(attribset_attribset42)

No. 0004
	String variable are not properly compared with strings (at least in
	some cases).
	(select_select67, select_select68, variable_variable24)

No. 0005
	MS.NET misses some kind of whitespaces.
	(Text_78273, Text_78274, Text_78276, Text_78281)

No. 0006
	disable-output-escaping is not working on xsl:text.
	(Text_78308, Text_78311, modified_78308, modified_78309, modified_78311)


Not sure the reason why:
	whitespace_whitespace35

Notes:

1. Roman numbering

	MS.NET has "Oxford style" which for example converts 99 as
	XXXXXXXXXIX. It is not violating XSLT 1.0 spec. However, section
	7.7.1 explicitly describes 4 and 9 as iv and ix, so the "strict"
	Oxford style violates the spec.

2. Name conflict in variables

	If there is a conflict between a template local variable and a
	for-each local variable, MS.NET raises an error. It is a spec bug
	that does not define the behavior (like "implementation MAY reort
	an error ..., or recover ...).
