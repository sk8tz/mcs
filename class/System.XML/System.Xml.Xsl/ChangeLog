	* XslTransform.cs: don't free the xml document used for the style sheet.
	xmlFreeStylesheet already does it. Correctly close the element tag for
	elements that don't have children. Added a couple of checks more.

	* XslTransform.cs: fixed a couple of Transform overloads and changed the
	library name in DllImport to make it work on windows too.

	* XslTransform.cs: implemented all Load and Transform methods. It uses
	libxml2 and libxslt. No more temp files. It's slow and memory consuming,
	but, well, that's XSLT... ;-). Idea from Zdravko Tashev.

	Now the Xsl web control works.

	* XslTransform.cs (Laod): Implemented the simple version that
	takes one XPathNavigator as argument.
	(Save): New private method for recreating the XML in text from a
	XPathNavigator
	(WriteCurrentNode):
	(WriteTree): private methods for generating the text XML from the
	XPathNavigator tree.

	* XslTransform.cs (Load): Implemented the methods, not
	including the ones that deal with XPathNavigator (hopefully those
	will come later).
	(Transform): Implemented the version that saves directly to a file.
	(Save): New private method for recreating the XML in text from
	from an XmlReader

	We're now P/Invoking libxslt for doing XSLT work.

	* XsltContext.cs: added 'PreserveWhitespace' abstract method
