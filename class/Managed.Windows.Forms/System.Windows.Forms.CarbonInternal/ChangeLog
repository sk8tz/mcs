	* ControlHandler.cs: Properly update our invalidated information when
	Quartz asks us to redraw.  This helps fix TabControl but introduces
	over-zealous drawing causing our flicker.  Implement visibility tracking
	to generate out WM_SHOWWINDOW calls.  Refactor mouse tracking to live
	entirely in MouseHandler.

	the new MouseEvents that we do handle.

	and AppDeactivated.  We hook these to remove overlay windows when the application
	looses focus.

	Translates these events to their WndProc equivalents and routes them to the appropriate
	Control.

	translated them to the WndProc message and routes it to the keyboard focus control.
	* MouseHandler.cs: Handles the global mouse events and sends the appropriate WM_MOUSEMOVE to the 
	control affected.

	or destroys them accordingly.
