	* X11Hwnd.cs: the IntPtr atom change broke the Array.Sort stuff I
	was doing.  Just remove it.

	* XplatUIX11-new.cs: add a message if Xlib.XInitThreads fails.

	* X11ThreadQueue.cs: another Date.Now -> Date.UtcNow fix.

	* X11RootHwnd.cs: remove the setting of Display.ActiveWindow from
	here.  move all the logic into X11Display.SetActiveWindow.

	* X11Display.cs: move the logic for setting ActiveWindow here, and
	make ModalWindows private.

	* Xlib.cs: remove the static keyword from the class

	* XplatUIX11-new.cs: implement the Idle event by adding/removing
	it from the applicable X11ThreadQueue and remove the OnIdle
	method.  Also, implement the new InvalidateNC method.

	* X11Display.cs: remove the idle dispatch code, as it can't be
	generated by the XEventThread.  It has to be generated by the
	threads running the various message pumps, as it has to be invoked
	on that same thread.  Factor out the use of Hwnd.EnabledHwnd along
	with the accompanying call to XTranslateCoordinates to a separate
	function (RedirectMsgToEnabledAncestor).  Fix some NRE's accessing
	FocusWindow, since it's not an IntPtr anymore but a X11Hwnd.

	* X11ThreadQueue.cs: move the Idle dispatch stuff here.  Also,
	correct the first arg to Idle - it's not the XplatUI, it's the
	Thread.

	* X11Hwnd.cs: numerous formatting changes, change the logic of
	some if statements to make things cleaner.  Factor out the
	USER_TIME manipulation from a few places. Change all atom
	manipulation to use IntPtr's instead of int's the way the old
	XplatUIX11 stuff worked.  This might help fix things for 64-bit
	platforms..  more work needed there.  Also, add the new
	InvalidateNC support (basically the same as the old
	InvalidateWholeWindow), and remove the InvalidateWholeWindow
	calls.

	* X11Hwnd.cs: port the XplatUIX11.ScrollWindow fix from 68061.

	* X11Hwnd.cs, X11RootHwnd.cs, X11Atoms.cs, X11Display.cs,
	X11Exception.cs, Xlib.cs: Initial pass at refactoring the X11
	backend.
