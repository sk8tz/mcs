	* RTF.cs: Added method to allow setting the default font for the RTF
	  document. This font will be used if the document does not contain
	  a font table.
	* Font.cs: Added method to delete font with a given number; 
	  changed set_Num to call this method (to allow replacing fonts
	  with the same number, particulary the default font)
