	* ScrollableControl.cs: Refactored the Recalculate method a
	little, this wasn't handling all the variants of bottom and right
	bars needed to be added and added/removed based on their
	counterparts being added/removed (which changes the drawable
	size). Also we special case client widths and heights of 0 and
	don't add the scrollbar for those.

	* Hwnd.cs: 
	  - Added logic to have default menu height if the actual menu height
	    has not yet been calculated (part of fix for #77426)
	* Form.cs: Keep track whether client size has been set and re-set 
	  it if a menu is added/removed afterwards (Fixes #77426)
