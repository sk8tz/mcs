** Introduction

  RelaxngValidatingReader is an implementation to validate XML with RELAX NG
  grammar. You can use full standard grammar components with it.

  Currently it supports only grammar xml syntax (in the future it will 
  support compact syntax).

  It supports RELAX NG predefined datatypes and XML Schema datatypes (its
  DatatypeLibrary is http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes ).


** Known bugs

  Currently it is beta version as yet. It has some bugs:

	- Grammar simplification is incorrectly implemented as yet. It will
	  fail to check incorrect recursion and might bind ref to incorrect
	  definitions.
	  not handle the same name define components properly.
	- Name class analysis and constraint check is not implemented (part
	  of spec 7).
	- Empty string won't be validated properly.
