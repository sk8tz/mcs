* standalone RELAX NG test program for the Test Suite

** Introduction

  It is a test runner for James Clark's test collection.

  prep.xsl is included in Jing (a Java implementation of RELAX NG validator).
  copying.html is license information for prep.xsl and relaxng.rng.

** Usage

  To set up test runner, you need xsltproc, which is included in libxslt.
  (Since the stylesheet uses extensions, we cannot use our xslt engine.)

  "make" will download the test collection from http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/testSuite.zip , run xsltproc and create test directories and files.

  "make test" will run the test program and will output the error cases.
