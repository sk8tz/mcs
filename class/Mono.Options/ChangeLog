	* Makefile: Don't bother installing Mono.Options.dll into the GAC (or
	  anywhere else), instead just follow a subset of the App Deployment 
	  Guidelines and install just the source into $prefix/lib/mono-options.

	* Makefile: Install Options.cs into the GAC, so that mono-options.pc
	  can perform source install (as suggeted by App Deployment Guidelines).

	* ChangeLog: Started.
	* Makefile: Added; build Mono.Options; do NOT install as an ABI-stable
	  package.

	* Mono.Options_test.dll.sources: Added; Test sources.
