	* Socket.cs: patch from Elan Feingold <efeingold@mn.rr.com>. Fixes
	NullReferenceException when the callback is null.

2003-02-17  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* NetworkStream.cs: allow 0 size array in Write.

2003-02-16  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: make Worker.Connect and Receive work with non-blocking
	sockets. May be Receive* and Send* in Worker need to do the same. I'll
	wait for bug reports. Set IsCompleted to true before invoking the end
	callback. Fixes bug #38136.

2003-01-23  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* NetworkStream.cs: the check for disposed should not be done in the
	finally clause.

2003-01-04  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* UdpClient.cs: fixed bug #36226.

2002-11-13  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Only close the socket in one place, ie the Dispose
	method.  Fixes bug 32054.

	* Socket.cs: offset == size == 0 it's ok in Send ().

2002-11-03  Phillip Pearson  <pp@myelin.co.nz>

	* TcpClient.cs: Fixed SetTcpClient() to pass through to the Client 
	property, which now sets stream to null (it's set by GetStream()).  This 
	should make GetStream() work on a TcpClient which has had the socket set 
	by assignment to the Client property, not only one that has been created 
	by TcpListener.AcceptTcpClient().

	* Socket.cs: 
	* NetworkStream.cs: Bounds checking fixes, and better exception
	texts.  Changes by timothyjmills@hotmail.com (Timothy J. Mills).

	* TcpClient.cs: NoDelay is a TCP option, not Socket

2002-09-16  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* SocketFlags.cs: Add missing enumeration.

	* UdpClient.cs: Make Dispose private.

2002-08-20  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Fix deadlock when the AsyncResult callback calls
	End*().  Set the async request's worker property so it can return
	results.  These two fixes combined fix bug 28092.

2002-06-24  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Make SetSocketOption cope with boolean values (they
	are passed as objects, not the ints the runtime was expecting)

2002-05-17  Lawrence Pit <loz@cable.a2000.nl>
 	* TcpListener.cs: Renamed LocalEndPoint to LocalEndpoint
	* NetworkStream.cs, UdpClient.cs and TcpClient.cs: modified disposable 
	routines, added	checks for disposed state.
	* UdpClient.cs: commented out GetHashCode and Equals as it's not
	overriden in ms.net implementation.

2002-05-17  Jaroslaw Kowalski <jarek@atm.com.pl>
	* TcpClient.cs: fixed SetTcpClient so that
	TcpListener.AcceptTcpClient works and allows
	you to call GetStream() on its result

2002-04-24  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs (Poll): Give correct argument to Select(), as spotted
	by Jaroslaw Kowalski <jarek@atm.com.pl>

2002-04-16  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* UdpClient.cs: implemented.

2002-04-02  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* TcpListener.cs: in Start(), set the socket listen backlog value
	to a sane value (noticed by Jonathan Stowe <gellyfish@gellyfish.com>)

2002-02-13  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Implemenent Select, Blocking, Connected,
	GetSocketOption, Poll, SetSocketOption and Shutdown

	* LingerOption.cs: Delete override methods that don't need to be
	implemented

	* NetworkStream.cs: Implement class.

2002-01-23  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* SocketException.cs: Implemented

	* Socket.cs: Implemented most methods

	* LingerOption.cs: Made compile

	* AddressFamily.cs: Removed empty auto-generated comments

2002-01-17  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* SocketException.cs: Reimplemented.

2002-01-06  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* ChangeLog : Add to this directory.

	attribute decoration.
