	* FAMWatcher.cs: move the call to StartMonitoringDirectory out of any
	locks. Before, for a high amount of subdirectories (~500) it hanged
	after filling the write buffer of FAM socket. Fixes bug #74398.

2005-04-05  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@novell.com>

	* FAMWatcher.cs: Fix cast exception when disposing watchers.

2005-03-30  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@customerdna.com>

	* KeventWatcher.cs: Fix a file handle leak on raised events.

2005-02-10  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@novell.com>

	* DefaultWatcher.cs: Fix nullref exception when the object is disposed
	without any watcher.

2004-12-03  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@customerdna.com>

        * SearchPattern.cs:  Have IsMatch(string)
        call IsMatch(string, bool) to avoid setting a instance variable in a
        method that logically should not be changing it.

2004-12-02  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@customerdna.com>

        * KeventWatcher.cs: Add IDisposable to our kevent struct
        so the disposer gets called.  Fixes a small memory leak.  Dont monitor
        LastAccessedTime for changed files, as this will cause AppUnloading in XSP
        when global.asax is accessed after creation.  Use a case-insensitive IsMatch
        to deal with OSX Case-aware/Case-insensitive filesystem.
        * SearchPattern.cs: Add a overload to IsMatch to explicitly set
        the ignore field for OSX case-aware yet case-insensitive filesystem.  This
        allows monitoring of global.asax to happen properly.

	* DefaultWatcher.cs: make it work when the FileMask does not have
	wildcards and we're watching a directory.

2004-11-22  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* DefaultWatcher.cs: Copy the hashtable when we scan for changes
	so that you can make modifications in a handler. Fixes 65966.

2004-11-19  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@customerdna.com>

        * KeventWatcher.cs:  Dont marshal a string to a struct
        that the kernel will hold; this causes a double free bug.  Marshal
        it as a IntPtr and clean it up in the dispose method.  Don't pass
        FullName to the pattern matcher, pass the filename.  Fixes bug #69692.

2004-10-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DefaultWatcher.cs: if the file is removed between reading the
	directory and filling the file info, catch the exception and ignore the
	file. Fixes bug #59482.

2004-10-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DefaultWatcher.cs: don't use Directory.GetFileSystemEntries when the
	pattern has no wildcards. Fixes bug #67447.

2004-09-04 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* FAMWatcher.cs: s/fam/libfam.so.0/ so that g_module finds it even
	when the development package is not installed.

2004-08-06  Geoff Norton <gnorton@customerdna.com>

	* FileSystemWatcher.cs: Use the new KeventWatcher if its supported
	* KeventWatcher.cs: Added to cvs

2004-06-24 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DefaultWatcher.cs: fixed subdirectories notifications and don't
	fail when any directory is removed. Closes bug #59840.

2004-05-09  Atsushi Enomoto <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* FileSystemWatcher.cs : csc build fix. Duplicate name between class
	  field and local variable. (already filed in bugzilla #47991).

2004-05-09  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DefaultWatcher.cs:
	* FAMWatcher.cs: use MangledFilter instead of Filter.

	* FileSystemWatcher.cs: added MangledFilter and finalizer.

	* SearchPattern.cs: fixed the case when the pattern is "*".

2004-03-30  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* FAMWatcher.cs: support monitoring subdirectories. FAM doesn't do that,
	so we have to register the existing directories and add the new ones
	that might be created.

	* SearchPattern.cs: provide the pattern when it's wrong.

2004-03-25  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* SearchPattern.cs: small improvement for files with no wildcard.

2004-01-27  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@ieee.org>

	* FAMWatcher.cs:
	* FileSystemWatcher.cs: Remove unused variables. Eliminates a couple of
	build warnings.

2004-01-26  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DefaultWatcher.cs: fixed condition for removal from the watches list.

2004-01-26  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DefaultWatcher.cs: check if the FileSystemWatcher is in WaitForChange
	and call Monitor.PulseAll in that case.

2004-01-21  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DefaultWatcher.cs: implemented.
	* FAMWatcher.cs: don't stop the thread when we add a new watch.
	* FileSystemWatcher.cs: on windows we use the default watcher by now.

2004-01-16  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DefaultWatcher.cs: stub for the default watcher.
	* WindowsWatcher.cs: stub for the windows watcher.
	
	* FAMWatcher.cs: FAM watcher.
	
	* FileAction.cs: enum with event types.
	
	* FileSystemEventArgs.cs: added SetName property.
	* FileSystemWatcher.cs: added support for the 3 watchers.

	* IFileWatcher.cs: interface implemented by the watchers. 
	* SearchPattern.cs: copied from corlib.

2003-07-17  Andreas Nahr <ClassDevelopment@A-SoftTech.com>

	* FileSystemWatcher.cs: Reworked attributes based on the new Consts
	scheme

2003-07-13  Andreas Nahr <ClassDevelopment@A-SoftTech.com>

	* FileSystemWatcher.cs: Added missing attributes

2003-07-09  Andreas Nahr <ClassDevelopment@A-SoftTech.com>

	* FileSystemWatcher.cs: added attributes and some more implementation.
	Now only the guts left to do.

	* FileSystemEventArgs.cs:
	* RenamedEventArgs.cs: implemented a couple of properties.

2002-10-31  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* MonoIO.cs: Return the error status in a parameter, as the
	GetLastError() value has long since been blown away if we try and
	look it up in a subsequent internal call invocation.

2002-09-15  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* FileSystemWatcher.cs (FileSystemWatcher): Fixed the null-param
	constructor.

2002-08-28  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* FileSystemWatcher.cs: IDisposable fixes.

2002-08-23  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

2002-07-20  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* MonoIO.cs: Cut down copy of corlib/System.IO/MonoIO.cs, so it
	can be used from the System assembly but still not be exposed to
	users.
