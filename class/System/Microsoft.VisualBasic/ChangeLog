	* VBCodeGenerator.cs: Added and nearly completely implemented
		(it compiles, but the functionallity is completely untested)
		(also without a working mbas the compilaton options will fail)
		(once all command line arguments for mbas are final and the warning output is final
		 change the apropriate code to generate these options)
	* VBCodeProvider.cs: Added and implemented
