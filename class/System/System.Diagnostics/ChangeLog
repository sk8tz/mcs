2006-05-16  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Dispose the handle from a destructor too

2006-04-04  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Stopwatch.cs:
	  Zoltan was quicker to add it, here I put my implementation ;-)
	* Process.cs :
	  Added some missing long members (not implemented anyways).
	* DataReceivedEventHandler.cs DataReceivedEventArgs.cs :
	  added new 2.0 types.

2006-04-01  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* Stopwatch.cs: New file.

2006-03-31  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* Debug.cs: Add net 2.0 Print methods.

2006-03-03  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

2006-01-12  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* ConsoleTraceListener.cs: New 2.0 class

2005-11-17  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Split Start_common into Start_shell and
	Start_noshell, which call ShellExecuteEx and CreateProcess
	respectively.  Fixes bug 76670.

2005-09-21 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: deal with the fact that someone can enable raising events
	and/or registed a Exited delegate before and *after* Start is called for
	the process. Only queue the exit callback in the threadpool when it's
	possible and requested. Fixes bug #76129.

2005-08-09  Gert Driesen <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* EventLog.cs: Fixed Designer attribute to match MS.NET.
	* ICollectData.cs: Added marshalling attribute to match MS.NET.

	passing on to listeners. Fixes some test failures.

2005-06-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DefaultTraceListener.cs: s/MONO_TRACE/MONO_TRACE_LISTENER/. The
	runtime uses MONO_TRACE too...

2005-05-31  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* PerformanceCounterPermissionEntry.cs: Added more 2.0 validations for
	machine names and PerformanceCounterPermissionAccess.

2005-02-22 Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* TraceImpl.cs: More Thread-safety fixes.  I have to lock on
	  Listeners.SyncRoot as we're traversing the collection and can't let the
	  collection change from underneath us while we're iterating over it
	  (alternately, we could clone the collection and iterate over the clone
	  without having locking issues -- assuming we had a lock-free clone -- 
	  but this would kill the GC).  Fixes 69964.  Only define lock_ if we're 
	  using the lock-free initialization routine; it's not used otherwise.

2005-01-18 Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs (DiagnosticsConfiguration): 
	  Use a lock-free algorithm for creating the settings information.
	* TraceImpl.cs (InitOnce): Use a lock-free algorithm for creating the
	  listeners collection and initializing the world.

2005-01-18 Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs (DiagnosticsConfiguration): Don't 
	  read the .config file from the static ctor (again), as if it fails we'll 
	  get a TypeLoadException -- bad!  Instead, lazy-read the .config file.
	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs (DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler): 
	  Require that the /switch/add/@value attribute contains only numeric values.
	* TraceImpl.cs: Don't initialize everything in the static ctor, as if it
	  fails (due to an invalid .confg file) we get a TypeLoadException, while
	  .NET generates a ConfigurationException.  Instead, initialize everything
	  the first time the Listeners property is accessed, which allows the static
	  ctor to run without chance of failure, avoiding the TypeLoadException.
	* TraceListenerCollection.cs: This should be thread-safe, as it's accessible
	  from a static member of TraceImpl (available through the public Debug and 
	  Trace classes).
	* Switch.cs: Leave the original switch value alone.  If it isn't valid 
	  (i.e. numeric), the DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler will catch it.

2005-01-17 Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: The /switch/add/@value attribute 
	  isn't optional under .NET 1.1, so make sure it exists.

2005-01-13 Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: Make DiagnosticsConfiguration.Settings
	  thread-safe (double-checked locking isn't thread safe on .NET without
	  using a volatile variable, and setting the variable in the static
	  constructor is easier anyway).
	* Switch.cs (GetConfigFileSetting): If the setting is non-numeric, set the
	  attribute value to the string "0".  This is apparently what .NET 1.1 does,
	  and allows the SwitchTest NUnit test to work w/o failures.

2004-12-06 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: always pass the same arguments to the runtime.

2004-09-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* EventLogPermission.cs: Completed implementation.
	* EventLogPermissionAccess.cs: Fixed enum values.

	* EventLogPermissionAccess.cs: Added new enums for NET_2_0 and added 
	[Obsolete] to some existing elements.

	and added [Obsolete] to some existing elements.
	* PerformanceCounterPermissionAttribute.cs: Added missing validations
	to properties (Path, MachineName). Fixed changes for NET_2_0.

2004-09-07  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Throw documented exceptions when getting stdin,
	stdout or stderr and they haven't been redirected.  Check that
	CreatePipe didn't fail, throw exceptions if it did.  Close
	redirected streams when the process is disposed, rather than rely
	on the GC disposing them later.  Makes timeline much happier,
	because it could run out of file descriptors between GC
	collections.

2004-09-06  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Make Dispose() actually dispose things.

2004-06-24  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	  the code comment.

	* Process.cs: separate the command and the arguments when calling
	Start_internal.

2004-05-19  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: redirecting I/O is not permitted if UseShellExecute is
	true. Also throw if FileName is null.

2004-04-06  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@ximian.com>

	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: If initializeData is provided,
	use the constructor that only takes one string as parameter to
	construct the listener. The name is set using the Name property, not the
	constructor.
	
	* TextWriterTraceListener.cs: In Write*, do nothing if no writer was 
	provided.

2004-03-25  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: use the ISynchronizeInvoke object to invoke the event.
	Implemented Close, CloseMainWindow and Kill.

2004-03-23 Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

2004-03-15  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: patch by Gert Driesen that fixes WaitForExit when the
	timeout is int.MaxValue.

2004-03-15  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: added environment variables setting support and also
	send useShellExecute to the runtime.

	* ProcessStartInfo.cs: support EnvironmentVariables.  MS uses
	StringDictionary, which turns keys into lowercase. We don't do that.

2004-02-22  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: ExitCode and ExitTime check that the process is finished.

2003-12-10  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: if there's an error when starting the process, the 'pid'
	field contains the GetLastError code. Use that for the Win32Exception.

2003-12-06  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* DefaultTraceListener: Don't use `where' in variable names.

2003-03-19  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Implement HasExited, fixes bug 39267

2003-03-13  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: throw an exception when the executable cannot be found.

2002-12-20  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: 
	  - Don't assume that optional attributes are always present
	  - <assert/> can't have any child nodes
	  - Change in semantics: if the attribute isn't present,
	    GetAttribute() returns null, not "".  This allows us to
	    differentiate between an attribute not being present and an
	    attribute with an empty value.
	  - Translate exceptions if a TraceListener type is invalid

2002-12-19  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* TraceListenerCollection.cs: IndentLevel and IndentSize shouldn't be 
	  hardcoded; they should be set to whatever TraceImpl is using (which
	  in turn may have been set by the .config file, so we should get the
	  user-specified values in added listeners).
	* TraceListener.cs: Make sure that indents are initially written.  This 
	  allows code that uses Trace.Indent() before a Trace.WriteLine() to be 
	  indented properly.
	* TraceImpl.cs: provide a static constructor to explicitly specify the
	  ordering of initialization, in particular the ordering of
	  TraceImpl.Listeners and the reading of the .config file (by
	  accessing DiagnosticsConfiguration.Settings).  This (hopefully)
	  ensures that the Listeners collection is initialized before the
	  .config file is read in, as the DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler will
	  directly modify the listeners collection.
	  The DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler assumes this so that it can
	  <add/> and <remove/> trace listeners and set the logfile for the
	  DefaultTraceListener.


2002-12-18  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* BooleanSwitch.cs: Complete re-write.  It works now.
	* DefaultTraceListener.cs:
	  - Use `const' strings, so I don't worry about copy/paste errors
	  - Give `AssertUiEnabled' an actual backing member
	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: To avoid race conditions, let the
	  configuration handler set .config-specified properties on
	  DefaultTraceListener (AssertUiEnabled, LogFileName) and TraceImpl
	  (AutoFlush, IndentSize).
	* Switch.cs: Near complete re-write.  Actually works, and is (should be)
	  comformant with .NET behavior.  Changed member names because they
	  were confusing me.  (Yes, that doesn't say much about my memory.)
	* TextWriterTraceListener.cs: Append text to already existing files,
	  don't overwrite them.
	* TraceImpl.cs:
	  - Added private destructor, to ensure no instances are created.
	  - Move members declarations to be closer to each other.
	* TraceSwitch.cs: Complete re-write.  It works now.

2002-12-17  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: Implement so that .config files
	support <system.diagnostics> sections.

2002-12-15  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	fixes.

2002-10-23  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Redirected standard input needs to have AutoFlush set

2002-09-27  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Implemented {get_,set_}{Min,Max}WorkingSet,
	ProcessName, GetProcessById, GetProcesses, GetProcessesByName.
	Pass the working directory to Start.  Pass the program and args in
	one string to be used with the second arg of CreateProcess, so it
	will search the path.

2002-09-19  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* TraceImpl.cs: Remove debug prints

2002-09-19  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>
