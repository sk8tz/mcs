	* regex.cs: use NextMatch to move on to the next match. Fixes bug
	#57274.

2004-11-09  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* parser.cs : cast.

2004-11-08  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* replace.cs, parser.cs: Use stringbuilder for allocation sanity.

2004-10-21 Joerg Rosenkranz <joergr@voelcker.com>

    * regex.cs: Fixed a bug introduced with the last patch which
      prevented any replacements when a postive count is given.
      This also happens in all overloads without count parameter.

2004-10-18 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* regex.cs: in Replace, when count is negative, replacement continues
	to the end of the string.

	Fixes bug #68398. Patch by Jon Larimer.

2004-06-10  Gert Driesen <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* RegexRunner.cs: fixed case mismatch of methods

2004-06-10  Gert Driesen <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* RegexRunner.cs: marked TODO, added missing protected internal
	fields, throw NotImplementedException in all methods

2004-06-10  Gert Driesen <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* RegexRunnerFactory.cs: removed comment, no longer throw exception
	from ctor
	* regex.cs: fixed public API signature by renaming protected 
	internal fields and adding destructor, added MonoTODO attribute to
	fields and method that are not yet implemented, changed not 
	implemented methods to throw NotImplementedException instead of
	Exception, fixed names of field that are serialized

2004-06-06  Jambunathan K <kjambunathan@novell.com>
	
	* parser.cs: Fixed issues with Regex.Unescape() identified as part of
	debugging bug #58256. The original problem reported was about
	inconsistency between the way we treat replacement patterns and the 
	way microsoft treats the replacement patterns in Regex.Replace(). MS
	implementation is buggy and doesn't honour escape sequences in the
	replacement patterns, even though the SDK claims otherwise.

	
2004-06-01  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* syntax.cs: re-applied my patch from 2004-05-27 plus a fix which is
	emitting a Category.All if both a category and its negated value are
	present.

2004-06-01  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* syntax.cs: reverting my previous patch. It causes bigger problems.

2004-05-27  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* category.cs: added LastValue field to mark the end of enum Category.
	* syntax.cs: in CharacterClass, use Category.LastValue to get the size
	of the array needed. Use a BitArray instead of bool[].
	In AddCategory(), don't set the opposite category as false. Fixes
	bug #59150. All tests pass.

2004-05-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* parser.cs: Allow creating a regular expression using {,n} as the
	specified. The min bounds is set to -1, I am not completely sure
	if that is what it is supposed to be but MS does not set it to 0
	based on testing. Patch by dave-gnome-bugs@earth.li. Fixes bug #56761.

2004-05-12  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* regex.cs:

	* RegexRunner.cs: More public API difference fixes.

	* GroupCollection.cs: 
	* MatchCollection.cs: 
	* CaptureCollection.cs: Moved GroupCollection, MatchCollection and
	CaptureCollection so that they no longer inherit from the
	non-standard RegexCollectionBase class.  Fixes the API difference.
