	* DnsTest.cs: Pick a URL we can most likely fail against.

2005-01-24  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@ieee.org>

	* ServicePointManagerTest.cs: Make sure we have some Service Points
	when we try to get one.

2005-01-20  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ServicePointManagerTest.cs: Add a TearDown method; add setup/teardown
	  logic to (1) record ServicePointManager.MaxServicePointIdleTime, and 
	  (2) set this to 10 milliseconds in setup.  Why?  Because when running the
	  full regression tests, the default timeout of 15 minutes applied, causing
	  the ServicePointManager to be "full" when ServicePointTest is executed.
	  This causes ServicePointTest to generate a failure, as it isn't able to
	  add as many ServicePoints as it expects.  Worse, this failure isn't
	  apparent if you run ServicePointTest individually; it only occurs if it
	  executes *after* ServicePointManagerTest.  Yay Heisenbugs.

2005-01-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* WebPermissionAttributeTest.cs: Removed a test for 1.1 as we delay 
	the regex creation (like 2.0) so the exception is also delayed.

2005-01-18  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* IPAddressTest.cs: Some tests may not work if support for IPv6 is
	disabled in machine.config. Tests haven't re-worked to check for
	Socket.SupportsIPv6 to ignore them in this case.

2005-01-18 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* IPAddressTest.cs: this test fails with a FormatException.

	* IPAddressTest.cs: Make tests pass on Fx1.1

2005-01-10  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@ieee.org>

	* SocketPermissionAttributeTest.cs: Do not run tests on .NET where there
	are bugs in the framework.

	make them pass on 1.1 too.

	Attribute.

2004-01-02  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ServicePointManagerTest.cs: Use the nunit v2 paradigm, and stop this
	test from outputting its debug info with WriteLines.
	* ServicePointTest.cs: Make sure MaxServicePoints weren't set to some
	other limit in another test or whatever.  Suppress debug output.

2003-12-30  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DnsTest.cs: Update with new IP address for www.go-mono.com and make
	test failure output more informative. All Tests pass for me on
	.NET 1.1.
	* HttpWebRequestTest.cs: Get rid of WriteLines and use Asserts to make
	it a proper unit test.

2003-07-16  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* IPAddressTest.cs: #if NET_1_1 for some IPv6 tests that
	rely on some NET_1_1-only features.
