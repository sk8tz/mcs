	* Component.cs: Eliminated compile errors by removing redundant fields and
	using the ISite member instead.  Also raised the Disposed event, but not
	sure if it's correct now.  Look for FIXME in the comments.

	* EventHandlerList.cs: New file.

	* Container.cs, Component.cs, IContainer.cs, IComponent.cs,
	ComponentCollection.cs, ISite.cs: New classes
