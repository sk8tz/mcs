	* MDStream.cs: Make Header a class and use a Read method to load it. Because it is no longer
	               being loaded by a utility method I can lower some accesibility levels.

	* MDStream.cs: Use PEUtils.GetString instead of new string (byte*)
	* Rows.cs: Cast a bunch of enums to int when displaying them otherwise an Exception is thrown.,
	           this is probably a bug but I haven't had time to track it down yet.
	* StringHeap.cs: Use PEUtils.GetString instead of new string (byte*)
