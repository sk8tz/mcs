	* WebService.cs: 
		Change Description to WebServicesDescription
	* WebServicesDescriptionAttribute.cs:
		Add back constructor as MS build doesn't
		seem to like it missing.  Now calls base()
		with the string.  Also remove the sealed
		modifier and change the attribute targets.

	* WebServicesDescriptionAttribute.cs:
		Removed the "guts" because they are defined in
		System.ComponentModel.DescriptionAttribute.
	* WebService.cs:
		Added attributes which were missing based on the
		class status page.  Also added an HttpApplication
		object and modified the properties to use that
		object.
