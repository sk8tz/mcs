This copy of Mono.Cecil is a snapshot of the upstream Mono.Cecil located at:

	http://github.com/jbevain/cecil

To update the snapshot, simply run:

	ruby update.rb

in mono/mcs/class/Mono.Cecil. You need to have an updated clone of the upstream
cecil in a sibling folder of your mono clone. You may have to update

	mono/data/cecil.pc.in

if Cecil's assembly version changed since the last update. This gets
picked up by mono-tools to locate Cecil.
