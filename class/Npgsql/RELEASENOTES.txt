    Npgsql 0.6 development release
    
    New Features:
        
        NpgsqlException now gives aceess to error collection through 
        the Errors property. This property return a collection of NpgsqlErrors objects. Also it gives access 
        to error message, hint, severity and code. This fixes the feature request 689 in gborg. Note the most of them are 
        only available in 7.4+ server versions. (Glen Parker (glenebob at nwlink dot com) )
        
        NpgsqlException is now used exclusively to sign erros from backend interation. In past, it was being used to sign other
        errors inside provider. This change gives more consistency to error handling logic. (Glen Parker (glenebob at nwlink dot com) )
        
    
    Bug fixes:
        
        Using Command and Prepare adds single quotes to strings twice (ID: 772) (Glen Parker)

    Npgsql 0.2 development release.
    
    In this version we got many things working...
    
    - You can send insert, update, delete queries through NpgsqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery() method.
    - You can send queries like, select count(*) from table, select version() with 
      NpgsqlCommand.ExecuteScalar() method.
    - There is logging support. (Thanks Dave Page)
      To use it, place code like that in your program:
      
      // Enable logging.
	  NpgsqlEventLog.Level = LogLevel.Debug;            // LogLevel.
	  NpgsqlEventLog.LogName = "NpgsqlTests.LogFile";   // LogFile.
    
    - You can use Npgsql with Mono (Thanks Kristis Makris). It is not working perfectly. :( 
    - There is a winforms test suite (Thanks Dave Page).
    - Clearer code in NpgsqlConnection removing *magic* numbers and constants. (Thanks Kristis Makris)
    - Better support of ODBC-like ConnectionString in NpgsqlConnection (Thanks Dave Page)
    - Thanks Ulrich Sprick for all discussion and ideas.
    
    And much more to come! 
    Thanks all team !

	First Npgsql beta release.
	In this version there is a limited functionality. It is only possible to
connect and disconnect from server.
	Only clear text authentication is supported right now.
	To compile you can use the SharpDevelop to open the Combine file (Npgsql.cmbx) or
type at command console: csc /t:library /out:Npgsql.dll NpgsqlConnection.cs AssemblyInfo.cs NpgsqlException.cs
This will create the file Npgsql.dll that can be copied to the application directory.

	I will be working in the Command functionality now.
	
	
	Play with it and send your bugs and comments :)
