The C5 library can be built by opening the solution file C5.sln in the
current directory with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or 
Microsoft Visual C# 2005 Express Edition and performing a build all. 
This will build C5.dll to the fileC5\C5\bin\Debug\C5.dll.

Building all in the C5.sln solution will also build the projects
* 'PreProcess' which does some preprocessing of the C5 sources and is an 
  integral part of the C5 build process.
* 'docNet' for generation of on-line documentation 
* 'UserGuideExample' containing the examples from the User's Guide.

The build should complete with a few compilation warnings.

To build the 'nunit' project you need to have NUnit 2.0 installed, else an enormous
number of compilation errors will result. The project is configured for NUnit
version 2.2.6 and tested with that version.
The NUnit tests should pass except for a single one due to missing implementation 
of events on the class SortedArray.
