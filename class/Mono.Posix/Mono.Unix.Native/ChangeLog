	* make-map.cs: Always use ordinal string sorting behavior.  The string
	  collation sorting has changed, so to keep the mono/support diff sizes down
	  we have to explicitly specify the previous implicit ordering.

	* Syscall.cs: Remove [CLSCompliant(false)] when it isn't needed.

	* FileNameMarshaler.cs: Use UnixMarshal.FreeHeap().  .Free() is obsolete.

2005-10-27  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Correct return type of setbuf(IntPtr, byte*).
	* Syscall.cs: Remove [Obsolete] SyslogFacility.LOG_USRE member
	  (Mono.Unix.Native hasn't shipped yet, so nobody is using it); correct
	  [Obsolete] comment for getpagesize().

	* FileNameMarshaler.cs: Deal with UnixMarshal method name changes.

	* Stdlib.cs: FilePosition should derive from MarshalByRefObject, for two
	  reasons: (1) it's a recommendation from FxCop that classes implementing
	  IDisposable also derive from MarshalByRefObject; (2) FilePosition is
	  exposed from Mono.Unix.StdioFileStream, which (indirectly) inherits from
	  MarshalByRefObject.  Fix Equals() so it doesn't rely on Reflection.

	* FileNameMarshaler.cs: Custom marshaler to marshal filenames using
	  Mono.Unix.UnixEncoding.  A custom marshaler is used to remove the need to
	  have ~6 lines of boilerplate on every method that takes filenames.
	* Stdlib.cs, Syscall.cs:  Filenames need to be marshaled through the
	  FileNameMarshaler, which will encode/decode filenames with UnixEncoder.

	* Stdlib.cs, Syscall.cs: Flush naming convention documentation.

	* NativeConvert.generated.cs: Flush currently generated version.

2005-10-14  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* make-map.cs: Fix documentation comment.
	* Stdlib.cs: Fix export of XprintfFunctions.syslog(); make SetLastError()
	  protected (normal user code shouldn't call it, as it isn't safe); 
	  replace functions which return `void' with functions which return `int'
	  (adding them to MonoPosixHelper.so as well) -- since users can't reliably
	  use SetLastError(), they need the "normal" error detection mechanism;
	  correct the strlen(3) export.
	* Syscall.cs: 
	  - s/PathConf/PathconfName/, s/SysConf/SysconfName/, s/ConfStr/ConfstrName/ 
	    to follow documented enumeration naming conventions.
	  - replace functions which return `void' with functions which return `int'
	    (adding them to MonoPosixHelper.so as well) -- since users can't reliably
	    use SetLastError(), they need the "normal" error detection mechanism;

	* Stdlib.cs: add strlen() to fix the build.

2005-09-23  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* make-map.cs: Generate NativeConvert documentation XML fragments for use in
	  monodoc.

2005-09-20  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* ChangeLog: Started.
	* CdeclFunction.cs: Copied from ../Mono.Unix; change namespace.
	* HeaderAttribute.cs: Added
	* make-map.cs: Copied from ../Mono.Unix; sort type and member names in
	  output (makes for a more stable svn history, as types/members won't change
	  position anymore within generated code); look for HeaderAttribute not
	  IncludeAttribute for getting headers & #defines; generate NativeConvert
	  partial class.
	* NativeConvert.cs: Copied from ../Mono.Unix; change namespace; turn into a
	  partial class; Remove generated code (generated code is in
	  NativeConvert.generated.cs).
	* NativeConvert.generated.cs: Added
	* Stdlib.cs: Copied from ../Mono.Unix; change namespace; rename Error to
	  Errno (as Error is a "reserved word" in FxCop); [CLSCompliant(false)]
	  support.
	* Syscall.cs: Use HeaderAttribute, not IncludeAttribute, for CLS compliance; 
	  add [CLSCompliant(false)] as needed; use NativeConvert, not UnixConvert.
