	* Syscall.cs: Use hex values for FileMode, since C# does not have
	an octal integer mode.

2004-03-30  Joshua Tauberer <tauberer@for.net>

	* Added readlink, strerror, opendir, readdir, closedir
	* Added Mono.Posix.Stat.UnixToDateTime(long unixtime) --> DateTime

	* Syscall.cs: Removed argument to getgid that shouldn't be there.
		Added getusername, getgroupname which wrap getpwuid, getgrgid
		without dealing with pointers to structures.
		Removed duplicate FileMode enum nested in Syscall class.
		Added stat and lstat, which use StatMode enumeration
		(like FileMode but nicer and complete) and Stat struct.
	* macros.c: Helper functions for getpwuid, getgrgid, stat, lstat.

	* Syscall.cs: moved the assembly attribute to a proper place
	and added 'signal.h'
	* make-map.cs: use reflection to invoke the properties, as it
	fails under MS runtime.
