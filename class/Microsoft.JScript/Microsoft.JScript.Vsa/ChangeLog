	* VsaEngine.cs: added an Stack, a VsaScriptScope, do not throw exceptions for:
	CreateEngineAndgetGlobalScope, GetGlobalScope, InitVsaEngine,
	PopScriptObject, PushScriptObject, the reason is for being able to
	run the tests at jtests. Be aware that this must get implemented yet.

	* VsaEngine.cs: uncommented inheritance from BaseVsaEngine (thanks
	goes to jackson). Added  constructor, added InitOptions,
	GetSpecificOption, SetSpecificOption.
