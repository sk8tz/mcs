Disclaimer: The EcmaScript compiler currently is only working on Windows,
because we need the JScript runtime support, that will be added in parallel but it's comming slowly.


Build:

* If you have antlr installed, you can build the lexer and parser with something like:  

	- java -cp /my/antlr/class/path antlr.Tool jscript-lexer-parser.g
	

Then you can build the parser with something like:

	csc /r:Microsoft.JScript.dll /r:antlr.runtime.dll /out:mjsc.exe *.cs


The antlr.runtime.dll assembly can be obtained from the antlr-2.7.2 tarball, I'll try to put one available somewhere.
