If you want to help on the Mono Jscript .Net compiler effort, here is
a list of things where you can start helping with:

1) Grammar.

- Add support for the extensions from MS for JScript .Net (classes,
  packages, interfaces, etc. This is included at the MS SDK docs - mostly).

2) Bug fixing.

Go to mcs/class/Microsoft.JScript/Test/Mozilla, check the tests that
are disabled at mjs-most.tests, choose one, fix the bug that stop us
from compiling and/or running it.

Thanks!
