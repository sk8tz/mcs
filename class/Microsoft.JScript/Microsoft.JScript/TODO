If you want to help on the Mono Jscript .Net compiler effort, here is
a list of things where you can start helping with:

1) Grammar.

- Add support for the extensions from MS for JScript .Net (classes,
  packages, interfaces, etc. This is included at the MS SDK docs - mostly).

1.1) Support for multiple files parsing. As each file parsed creates a
     new class (on the new assembly) named by sequential number.

2) Runtime support.

- URGENT: Implement the classes: Plus (focus on EvaluatePlus method),
  Equality (focus on EvaluateEquality method), Relational (focus on
  EvaluateRelational method), NumericBinary (focus on
  EvaluateNumericBinary), NumericUnary (focus on EvaluateUnary).

- The building block for this is the VsaEngine, and of particular
interest are the classes:

	 - GlobalScope (which is the implementation of the so called
	   'Global Object' at the spec.
	 - ScriptObject
	 - ScriptFunction

Thanks!
