	* BaseVsaEngine.cs: Implemented the properties of "the kind of
	state machine" that BaseVsaEngine is. There are some tiny details
	- properly marked to be fixed - missing ;-). They were: Assembly,
	Evidence, GenerateDebug, IsCompiled, IsDirty, IsRunning, Language,
	LCID, Name, RootMoniker, RootNamespace, Site.
