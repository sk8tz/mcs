	* SqlConnection (SetDefaultConnectionParameters):
	Changed default value of WORKSTATION ID to reflect real
	host name instead of "localhost".

2003-11-16 Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* SqlParameterCollection.cs (Clear): Clear needs to take
	the parameter out of the collection so that it can be used
	again.
	(Remove):
	(RemoveAt): Ditto.

	* SqlCommand.cs: no change.

	* SqlConnection.cs (Close): Added checks for null instance
	variables.

	* SqlParameter.cs (Direction): Now handles parameters of type
	ReturnValue and InputOutput.

	* SqlParameterCollection.cs (IndexOf(string)): Search for
	SqlParameter object in list is done by obtaining ParameterName
	attribute, not directly through list.IndexOf().

	* SqlCommand.cs (ExecuteNonQuery): Return
	Connection.Tds.RecordsAffected if it is successful.  Patch from
	Jörg Rosenkranz <joergr@voelcker.com>.

	This is part of a fix to bug #40315.

	* SqlConnectionPool.cs (ReleaseConnection): A patch from Joerg
	Rosenkranz <JoergR@voelcker.com>. Currently, if a connection is
	closed by an external event (network problem, etc.) it is pushed
	back into the connection pool. The next Open call retrieves this
	invalid connection which leads to exceptions when executing
	statements.

	This patch fixes this problem. This closes bug #47429.

	* SqlDataReader.cs: Added extra information to the exceptions
	thrown by all the GetXXXX methods.

	* SqlConnection.cs: if Server in the ConnectionString
	is set to "(local", use "localhost" as the hostname
	to connect

2003-03-04  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* SqlException.cs: implemented GetObjectData ().

2003-02-16  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>

	* ChangeLog: added this file

	* SqlConnection.cs: - parse data source for 3 possible uses:
	"Server=hostname", 
	"Server=hostname\\instancename", 
	"Server=hostname,port" and open the connection based on the
	resulting server name and port.  
	- Added support for named instances
	by discovery of the sql server tcp port via the sql monitor (udp port 1434)
	thanks to Phillip Jerkins (Phillip.Jerkins@morgankeegan.com) contribution.
	Also, thanks to Gonzalo and Tim for their help with timeouts.
