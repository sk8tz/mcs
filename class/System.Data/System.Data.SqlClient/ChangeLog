	* ChangeLog: added this file

	* SqlConnection.cs: - parse data source for 3 possible uses:
	"Server=hostname", 
	"Server=hostname\\instancename", 
	"Server=hostname,port" and open the connection based on the
	resulting server name and port.  
	- Added support for named instances
	by discovery of the sql server tcp port via the sql monitor (udp port 1434)
	thanks to Phillip Jerkins (Phillip.Jerkins@morgankeegan.com) contribution.
	Also, thanks to Gonzalo and Tim for their help with timeouts.
