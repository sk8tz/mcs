	* DbDataAdapter.cs: Update (DataSet) updates the default
	table only.

2003-02-25  Alan Tam <Tam@SiuLung.com>
	
	* DbDataAdapter.cs: Added support for filling when schema is present.
	Fixed incorrect behavior when ColumnMapping is present
	when more than one fields have the same name. Implemented Dispose.
	Fixed error when there is no ColumnMapping at all.
	Still have some problems in finding the correct TableMapping
	because the SourceTable name is not present in BuildSchema

	* DbDataAdapter.cs: The original code might pass a null DataTableMapping
	value which is then used to create a RowUpdatingEventArgs
	instance. So RowUpdatingEvent handler (for instance
	CommandBuilder) could get null DataTableMapping which
	might be unexpected. The patch makes sure that a non-null
	DataTableMapping is passed.

	* DbEnumerator.cs: why does the runtime throw an invalid cast here? The
	object is an Int16... Gotta fill a bug report and when fixed undo this
	patch.

	* DbDataRecord.cs: return DbNull.Value in GetValue () if value is null.

	* SchemaInfo.cs: added missing properties to fix mcs build

	* DataTableMapping.cs, DataTableMappingCollection.cs: comment out
	interfaces we do not implement yet.

	* DbDataAdapter.cs: Stub IEnumerable, comment out interfaces
	we do not implement yet.

	* DbDataPermissionAttribute.cs: call base constructor.
