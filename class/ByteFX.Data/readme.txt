Managed Drivers for MySQL and PostgreSQL
======================================

Current Status of MySQL driver
----------------------------------
The driver is currently under heavy development.
The driver is in beta form with most features working reasonably well, but
is not very well tested.  Use at your own risk!



The goal for version 0.7 is to use many more test cases and improve the stability
of the driver greatly.


Current status of the PostgreSQL driver
---------------------------------------
The PostgreSQL driver is just starting and not really usable yet. 
It can perform simple reads with a limited set of data types.
Watch the project over the next few weeks to see much 
improvement.


Credit
---------------------------------------
First of all, many thanks to the MySQL folks for creating such a great database.

Next, I have to give a big thanks and kudos to Mark Matthews for his Java-based MySQL driver.
As the protocol to MySQL is very poorly documented, his driver proved to be invaluable.

Also, I have to give thanks for Jun Su for starting the SourceForge project and for his wonderful
contribution of code and ideas.

Thanks also go out to Peter Belbin, Timoth Parez, and Daniel Morgan for their input, testing, and all
the other things that make open source projects successful!
