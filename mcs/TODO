* Namespaces.

	Currently the code can not resolve identifiers in other
	namespaces.

	namespace A {
		class X : B {
		}
	}

	namespace A {
		class B {
		}
	}

* Known problems:

  Can not parse try {} catch {}

	Have not figured out why.

  Cast expressions

	They should should use:

		OPEN_PARENS type CLOSE_PARENS

	instead of the current production which is wrong, because it
	only handles a few cases.

	Complex casts like:

		Array r = (string []) object

	Wont be parsed.
