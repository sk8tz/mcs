* Ordering

	First define methods and operator overloads.

	Do enumerations and constants.

	Process function bodies

	Can a constant_expression invoke overloaded operators?
	Explicit user-defined conversions?

* Tokenizer

	Propagate file/location to upper layers

* Error handling

	Normalize, and use Tokenizer location 

* Enumerations

	Currently I am not resolving enumerations.

	Either I track them with `RecordEnum' as I do with classes,
	structs and interfaces or I rewrite the code to visit type
	containers and `walk' the enums with this process. 

* Known problems:

  Can not parse try {} catch {}

	Have not figured out why.

  Cast expressions

	They should should use:

		OPEN_PARENS type CLOSE_PARENS

	instead of the current production which is wrong, because it
	only handles a few cases.

	Complex casts like:

		Array r = (string []) object

	Wont be parsed.
