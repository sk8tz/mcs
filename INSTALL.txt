Basic Installation
==================

The Mono project has developed mono, an x86-specific CL JIT compiler and
mint, a portable CLI interpreter. The build process of each of these
depends on nothing more than a C compiler, glib2 and libgc.

However, to provide a working runtime environment, these programs must
be supplemented by corlib, a CLR assembly to which they are closely
tied. This package provides the C# sources for corlib as well as some
additional assemblies and mcs, the Mono C# compiler.

To build this package, you must already have a C# compiler installed.
Build instructions for *NIX and Microsoft Windows follow.

Building mcs
============

These instructions apply to both Unix and Windows.  You need GNU make
to build the software (on Windows, you will need for example the
Cygwin environment setup)

To build the compiler and class libraries, run:

    make

The libraries will be placed in the directory class/lib/ and the mcs
compiler executable in mcs/.

To install them, run the following:

    make install

The default is /usr/local, to change this configuration option type:

    echo prefix=/your-prefix > build/config.make

If you are tracking Mono's development, you may sometimes need to share
the compiled libraries with others, you can do:

    make monocharge

Or a light version:

    make monocharge-lite


Configuration
-------------

If you want to change the configuration options for the build process,
place your configuration options in build/config.make

A list of variables that control the build are listed in the
build/config-default.make
