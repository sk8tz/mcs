	* mb-parser.jay: Temporarily remove the references to
	Class.MustOverride to fix the build.

2003/03/29  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com>
	* mb-parser.jay: corrected some module related rules
	* location.cs : now handles column information
	
2003/03/11  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com>
	* makefile.gnu : use $RUNTIME for all targets
					 actually run the compiled program on 'test-gtk' target 
	* mb-tokenizer.cs : no escaping of chars allowed in VB.NET (old mcs code removed)
						handle doubled-doublequotes (VB idiom to escape a doublequote) 
	
2003/03/04  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com>
	* mb-parser.jay: added rule for Imports with alias
	* mb-parser.jay: Friend (internal) modifier was missing,
					 Shared modifier was expecting Static token erroneously
					 Modules must accept only a static constructor rule added
					 Constant declaration rule added
	* makefile & makefile.gnu : actually run the compiled program on test target 

2003/03/03  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com>
	* mb-tokenizer.cs : new semi-keywords: Compare, Explicit, Strict, On, Off, Binary, Text
	* mb-parser.jay: tokens for above semi-keywords, and rules for option directives
	* driver.cs: integrates command line options with parser flags for option directives
	* makefile & makefile.gnu : added 'verbose' target that uses --verbose switch to compile 
	  the test source and pipes it through 'less', also added a Extended Syntax source

2003/02/22  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com>
	* class.cs : As, per vbc, there is a rootnamespace now, --main wasn't working anymore, 
				 because it was expecting a fully qualified class name. 
				 We now also test the name passed prepended by the rootnamespace.
	* class.cs : Corrected warning "The keyword new is required on `Mono.CSharp.Property.Emit'
				 because it hides inherited member `PropertyBase.Emit'", by making it virtual
				 in PropertyBase and override in Property.
	* makefile.gnu : test and test-gtk targets now depend on mbas.exe
				 

2003/02/19  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com>
	* mb-parser.jay : eliminated reduce/reduce conflict on duplicated rank_specifier rule
	  by renaming the one using brackets to bracketed_rank_specifier

2003/02/12  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com>
	* added argument.cs (extracted from expression.cs) makefiles corrected
	* mb-parser.jay : eliminated reduce/reduce conflict on opt_argument_list rule, 
	  by putting and if to make a argument list with just an empty argument list become an empty list

2003/02/03  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com>
	* rootcontext.cs : added RootNamespace member
	* mb-parser.jay : use RootContext.RootNamespace to initialize outermost namespace
	* driver.cs : 
		- implement rootnamespace parameter, and defaults it to the output file name
		- like vbc if no source file name is provided just show help

2003/01/22  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>
	* makefile: Use csc compiler in here. makefile.gnu assumes mono/mcs
