Notes for Martin:

	* We merged manually the patch from Sebastien from, this is the
	only patch that is not part of the regular mcs/gmcs merger process. 

2004-04-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* codegen.cs: Fix another case where CS1548 must be reported (when 
	delay-sign isn't specified and no private is available #56564). Fix
	loading	the ECMA "key" to delay-sign an assembly. Report a CS1548 
	error when MCS is used on the MS runtime and we need to delay-sign 
	(which seems unsupported by AssemblyBuilder - see #56621).
