	Imported NUnit 1.11.

	* nunit.build: Added NAnt build file for NUnit. In addition to
	NUnitConsole.exe and NUnitCore.dll, we also create a small
	NUnitBase.dll which just contains the source files which are needed
	to run the tests on Linux.

	* RunTests.cs: This is a simple test runner which is used when we
	run the tests on Linux. It is linked into UNitBase.dll.

	* makefile: Just call NAnt here.

	* NUnitGUI.exe, NUnitTests.dll: Removed binaries.
