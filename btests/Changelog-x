	* Makefile: Removed inclusion of rules.make from Makefile for two reasons :
                - This Makefile as of now has no dependency on rules.make what so ever
                - Because of inclusion of INTENAL_MBAS in rules.make it was causing confliction with existing INTERNAL_MBAS in this makefile and causing lots of tests to fail

	* Makefile: corrected /libpath: compiler flag (parameter) to point to ../class/lib/default/ the new location of libraries

	* Test1.vb: corrected mispelling in keyword
	* Test.Sources: no misc1.vb or CharacterLiteralsA.vb sources
	* ConditionalCompilationC.vb: added some tests with #Const
