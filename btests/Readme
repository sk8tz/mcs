* Organization of Test Cases:

	There are three different kinds of mbas Test Cases

	* Positive Tests: These test cases should compile and run
          without failure. Any failure during compile and run is
          deemed as a bug in the compiler or run time.

	* Negative Tests: These test cases trigger a compile time
          failure with a pre-determined error number at pre-determined
          location within the source file. A successful compilation or
          a failure at a different line or with a different error
          number is deemed as a bug in the compiler.

	* Negative Run Time Tests: These test cases should trigger a
          pre-determined run time error. A successful execution or a
          run-time error that is any different is deemed as a bug in
          the compiler.

* Contributing Test Cases:

	* All test cases are listed in the file Test.Sources under one
          of TEST_SOURCES, TEST_NGTIVE_COMPILATION_SOURCES,
          TEST_NGTIVE_RUNTIME_SOURCES as appropriate. Refer the
          previous paragraph to understand what these exactly mean.

* Running Test Cases: 

  	* To run tests do a 'make'. All the console messages get
    	  redirected to results.out file.
