This is a port of Jay to C#, the original Jay can be found here:
	http://www.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/bernd/jay/

This is a temporary solution as we move to a Bison-generated parser
as it would provide better error recovery (and error productions
are broken in my port of Jay).

The original README from Jay is in `README.jay'
