Test cases listed by Number:
============================

test-146.cs
-----------
Test for Binary.EmitBrancheable() to ensure we're emitting correct
unsinged branch targets.

test-147.cs
-----------
Testing `new' modifier.

test-148.cs
-----------
Testing the `IndexerName' attribute in interface indexers.

test-149.cs
-----------
Testing interface events.

test-150.cs
-----------
Test for folding of UIntConstants.  See bug #28106.
FIXME:  We should all all possible test cases to this test.

test-151.cs
-----------

  A.Iface b;
  void doit (Object A) {
    b = (A.Iface)A;
 }

test-152.cs
-----------
Scope of variables declared inside a switch case.

test-153.cs
-----------
Testing invocation of varargs function.

test-154.cs
-----------
Flow analysis: This test contains all situations which are "allowed".

test-155.cs
-----------
Nested interfaces.

test-156.cs
-----------
Check whether base types are at least as accessible than the current type.

test-157.cs
-----------
Attributes.

test-158.cs
-----------
Attributes.

test-159.cs
-----------
SimpleNameLookup: Cast to `A.Iface' type when there's a parameter called `A'.

test-160.cs
-----------
ResolveMemberLookup: `B look; return look.s.a' must work in static context.

test-161.cs
-----------
ResolveMemberLookup: Field initializer references `DateTime.Now' when there's
an instance property/field `DateTime'.

test-162.cs
-----------
Control Flow Analysis wrt. structs.

test-163.cs
-----------
Test to check we select string over object when we have a Null literal as the argument.

test-164.cs
-----------
Virtual functions in delegate creation expressions.

test-165.cs
-----------
Enums in array creation expression.

test-166.cs
-----------
Using property from interface which is inherited multiple times.

test-173.cs
-----------
Check whether we select the correct function, don't report CS0121
for integer literals.

test-174.cs
-----------
Checks access to protected properties on base classes, and access to 
private properties on container classes.

test-175.cs
-----------
Check for user-defined implicit conversions if both arguments of a
binary operator are of a user-defined type.  Bug #30443.

test-176.cs
-----------
This tests checks that we perform constant folding on byte values.  The
compiler had a bug where it did not do so.

test-177.cs
-----------
This tests that the compiler is generating "return:" attributes for a 
method.  This was a separate code path, and was not handled in the past.

test-179.cs
-----------
Tests various uses of the indexers in the presence of the `new' keyword
and various different argument types.

test-180.cs
-----------
This test is part of a bug report in which casting an enumeration value
into System.Enum was not wrapped correctly, and the wrong method was
called.

test-181.cs
-----------
Test whenever mcs correctly handles the MethodImplAttributes
custom attribute.

test-182.cs
-----------
Tests that bug 37473 is gone.  The problem was that we were generating
incorrect code for field references on a value type.  The code was originally
written by Martin, but I turned it off as I did not see what it did fix.  The
code is now turned on again.  

test-183.cs
-----------
This test just verifies that we generate the proper signature for
EndInvoke, something that we were not doing before in the presence
of out parameters

test-184.cs
-----------
This test fixes a bug that exposed a problem when calling a struct
constructor that is initialized from an instance constructor

test-185.cs
-----------
Flow analysis wrt. infinite loops.  Bug #37708.

test-186.cs
-----------
Typecasts were not being constant-folded/reduced, which triggered
the bug 37363.   (String) null was not a null constant in attributes.

test-187.cs
-----------
This test verifies that we resolve the source expression in a compound
expression before we attempt to use it.

test-188.cs
-----------
Test that the foreach statement generated by mcs invokes the Dispose()
method even if the enumerator class returned by GetEnumerator () does not
implement IDisposable.

test-190.cs
-----------
Accessing private field of outer class from which we derive.

tests-191.cs
------------
Some accessibility tests that exist in Corlib and System, to probe the new
functionality in the compiler for accessibility of private nested classes.

test-192.cs
-----------
Fix for bug 41952, basically, we were not using the `unchecked' bit during
constant resolution due to the nature of EmitMeta.

test-193.cs
-----------
Fix for bug 39828, allow goto to a label in another switch section.

test-194.cs
-----------
Fix for bug #39108 - ensure that the correct form of a params method is called:

"explicit conversion of argument to object
(type object cannot be implicitly converted to type
object[]) affects resolution of normal/expanded form
of method invocation."

test-195.cs
-----------

Fix for bug #45149, constructors that call another constructor in the
same class (using ": this()") should not emit instance field initializers. 

verify-1.cs
-----------
Test whether we do not jump out of the method in a Try/Finally block.

verify-2.cs
-----------
Test whether `return' in a Try/Catch block actually returns.  Test
whether continue uses Leave when the branch is across Try/Catch
boundaries.

verify-3.cs
-----------
Checks default add/remove method of static events.

verify-4.cs
-----------
When there's an unreachable break in a switch section, it must not emit a jump out of
the method.

verify-6.cs
-----------
Casts from/to System.Enum.

unsafe-6.cs:
------------
Tests the correct computation of compound operators in the context of a pointer 
dereference on the left side.
