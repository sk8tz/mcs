compiler had a bug where it did not do so.

method.  This was a separate code path, and was not handled in the past.


test-178.cs

called.

-----------
Test whenever mcs correctly handles the MethodImplAttributes
custom attribute.

test-182.cs
-----------
Tests that bug 37473 is gone.  The problem was that we were generating
incorrect code for field references on a value type.  The code was originally
written by Martin, but I turned it off as I did not see what it did fix.  The
code is now turned on again.  

test-183.cs
-----------
This test just verifies that we generate the proper signature for
EndInvoke, something that we were not doing before in the presence
of out parameters

test-184.cs
-----------

constructor that is initialized from an instance constructor

test-185.cs
-----------
Flow analysis wrt. infinite loops.  Bug #37708.

test-186.cs
-----------
Typecasts were not being constant-folded/reduced, which triggered
the bug 37363.   (String) null was not a null constant in attributes.

test-187.cs
-----------
This test verifies that we resolve the source expression in a compound
expression before we attempt to use it.

test-188.cs
-----------
Test that the foreach statement generated by mcs invokes the Dispose()
method even if the enumerator class returned by GetEnumerator () does not
implement IDisposable.

test-189.cs
-----------
Test to ensure proper overload resolution of params method under various cases.

test-190.cs
-----------
Accessing private field of outer class from which we derive.

tests-191.cs
------------
Some accessibility tests that exist in Corlib and System, to probe the new
functionality in the compiler for accessibility of private nested classes.

test-192.cs
-----------
Fix for bug 41952, basically, we were not using the `unchecked' bit during
constant resolution due to the nature of EmitMeta.

test-193.cs
-----------
Fix for bug 39828, allow goto to a label in another switch section.

test-194.cs
-----------
Fix for bug #39108 - ensure that the correct form of a params method is called:

"explicit conversion of argument to object
(type object cannot be implicitly converted to type
object[]) affects resolution of normal/expanded form
of method invocation."

test-195.cs
-----------

Fix for bug #45149, constructors that call another constructor in the
same class (using ": this()") should not emit instance field initializers. 

test-196.cs:
------------

The optimization that we perform in uint & int-constant was triggering a bug
because we returned always, when we should have continued the processing if the
conditions were not correct.

test-197.cs

test-198.cs
-----------

Type resolution and name lookup.  Fixes for bugs #36316, #36314.

fact that New is called for DoResolve twice from array initialization.
Bug #48800

test-219.cs:
------------
Tests that we can call typeof(void) in an attribtue delcaration, since
we removed previously typeof (System.Void) as a valid way of referencing void.

whether continue uses Leave when the branch is across Try/Catch
boundaries.

Checks default add/remove method of static events.

verify-4.cs
-----------
When there's an unreachable break in a switch section, it must not emit a jump out of
the method.

dereference on the left side.
