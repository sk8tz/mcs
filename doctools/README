A couple things:

* Compiling and installing

Make sure you've got Qt# (http://qtcsharp.sourceforge.net) installed.
Email the Qt# mailing list or ask on IRC (FreeNode's #qtsharp) if you
have any problems installing. Note: You'll need to install the Qt
toolkit (v3.0.x) and the Qt C bindings (found in the kdebindings package
of the KDE distribution) to install Qt#.

To compile, type 'make' in the mcs/doctools directory. To install, type
'make PREFIX=<prefix>', where <prefix> should be the same prefix you used
when you installed mono. If you don't specify a prefix, /usr/local is the
default.

Build environment configurables are found in Makefile.defs.

* Info

The 'lib' directory contains the xml parser and data representation
of the Master.xml files.  This will be the common library between the
qt#, ASP.NET, and gtk# clients.  It will also contain the serializer
for saving the xml to our monodoc.dtd format.

monodoc-qt contains the Qt# documentation editor. To use just
'mono monodoc.exe' and open the corresponding Master.xml
(example: mcs/class/corlib/doc/mscorlib.xml)  Have fun.
