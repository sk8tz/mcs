A couple things:

* To compile: make sure you have Qt# installed.  This can be found at
http://qtcsharp.sourceforge.net.  There is a mailing list and IRC 
(OpenProjects.net #qtcsharp) channel for any questions. Note: You'll need
to install the Qt toolkit and the qtc bindings ;) Then:

mcs -o monodoc.exe -r Qt monodoc-qt/*.cs lib/*.cs

AND

mkdir ~HOMEDIR/.monodoc; mkdir ~HOMEDIR/.monodoc/images; cp monodoc-qt/images/* ~HOMEDIR/.monodoc/images/

* The 'lib' directory contains the xml parser and data representation
of the Master.xml files.  This will be the common library between the
qt#, ASP.NET, and gtk# clients.  It will also contain the serializer
for saving the xml to our monodoc.dtd format.

* monodoc-qt contains the Qt# documentation editor. To use just
'mono monodoc.exe' and open the corresponding Master.xml
(example: mcs/class/corlib/doc/mscorlib.xml)  Have fun.
