The NAnt buildfile for doctools uses tasks that exist in NAnt 0.7.x,
and are not available in the version of NAnt (0.6) in our CVS tree.
As I really don't want to go through the hell of getting the newer version
of NAnt into our tree, the makefile and build files under doctools require
NAnt 0.7.x or greater to be in the path somewhere.
