	* fail: cs0121.cs, cs0157.cs and cs1501.cs no longer fail.  
	* cs0176.cs: Method has to be public for correct test
	* cs0196.cs, cs0242.cs: Do 'return' to stop null statement warning.
	* cs0255.cs: Add assignment to stop 'unused variable' warning.
	* makefile: Output is now like "Running test 42 .. OK".  Added --unsafe to 
	  make cs0193.cs, cs0196.cs and cs0214-3.cs work.
