	Mono MCS Errors contributors readme

	Created: 01/14/2003. First revised:
	
  If you are willing to contribute to the errors tests,
  you should follow the following procedure.

	* Visit the URL: 
	
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cscomp/html/vctbsCompilerErrorsSC0001ThroughSC9999.asp
	
	We are writing at least one test per each error 
	CSXXXX documented in that URL. So check the mcs/errors
	directory for missing csXXXX.cs files, where a csXXXX.cs
	file is a simple error test for a concrete bug.

	* Contact raciel@gnome.org, jaime@gnome.org 
	or the mono list: mono-list@ximian.com before you
	start so we can provide you with a list of errors 
	that are unassigned. Otherwise you might start
	writing already assigned errors tests.

	
	
	Template for an error test:

	The file should be named: csXXXX.cs according to the
	error number.

	The file should start with two inline commented lines.
	The first one contains a little description of the error.
	You can't just copy it from Microsoft's documentation. 
	Invent your own. 
	The second line declares the line where the error occurs.
	
	F.ex: 
	// cs0057.cs: Inconsistent accessibility. Parameter type is less accessible than operator.
	// Line: 10

	Then you can write the code for your test. You can also
	add inline comments for the copyright, etc if you want
	to. Look at the other tests for examples.

	There shouldn't be two or more errors per tests. This is
	you write a test for each error and the code shouldn't
	have more errors than the one trying to show and that
	appears at the line commented in the second line of the
	file.

	Then you have to add the file to the CVS and commit it.

	The next thing is to write a short text file with a little
	description of what the error is and what it's necessary
	to be done to solve it. F.ex, if the error is that there 
	is no entrypoint in the program, you could say:
	"Error CSXXXX: no entrypoint defined. You need to specify
	an entrypoint or compile with /target:library (F.ex.).
	The file must be called csXXXX.txt
