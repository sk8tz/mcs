	* CorCompare.exe.sources: not needed now.
	 
	* Makefile: updated to build the 3 exes we have now.

	* mono-api-info.cs: new program. Given an assembly name, it generates
	an xml file with its public data.

	* mono-api-diff.cs: compares 2 xml files generated with mono-api-info
	and outputs an xml file suitable for building class status pages with
	mono-api.xsl.

	* mono-api.xsl: small modifications to corcompare.xsl to match the new
	file format.

	sub-members, not just direct members

	* MissingNameSpace.cs: Fixed the case where a private/ internal class
	that per chance has a class with the same name in the compared
	assembly gets compared -> now only public classes are compared.
	* MissingType: Internal nested types were always compared -> internal
	nested types are never compared

	* ToDoAssembly.cs: remove unused code 
	* ToDoNamespace.cs: using BindingFlags for GetMembers
	* ToDoType.cs: throw exception if we encounter a member type
	that we didn't expect. Also remove unused property.
