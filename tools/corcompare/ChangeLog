	* MissingNameSpace.cs: Fixed the case where a private/ internal class that per chance has a class with the same name
				in the compared assembly gets compared -> now only public classes are compared.
	* MissingType: Internal nested types were always compared -> internal nested types are never compared

	* ToDoAssembly.cs: remove unused code 
	* ToDoNamespace.cs: using BindingFlags for GetMembers
	* ToDoType.cs: throw exception if we encounter a member type
	that we didn't expect. Also remove unused property.
