cilc
====

cilc is a CIL-to-C binding generator. It can be used to expose any CIL library
to the C (and C++) world using the GObject object model and coding style. This
should be of particular interest to GNOME developers who wish to make use of
libraries developed in C#, perhaps Gtk# widgets, within their own C
applications. Developers who use a generated binding need no specific knowledge
pertaining to Mono and runtime embedding -- almost everything is done behind
the scenes.

Right now, cilc is in an early stage of development. See TODO for a list of
pending tasks.

For a demonstration, see Test.cs and demo.c to get an idea of what's going on.
Then run:

$ make test
$ cd generated
$ ./demo
$ make test
$ cd generated
$ ./demo
c# static method invoked
c# ctor invoked
c# instance method invoked
c# method with an unusual name invoked
