TODO
====

Make cilc.exe installable and provide a man page in mono/man

--

Support method arguments

--

Complete GObject support including macros and GType, taking into account
inheritance etc.

--

Enums, delegates, events etc.

--

generate autoconf/automake build files. set AC_VERSION using the assembly's
version attribute

--

Automatically generate inline API documentation using documentation in the
Monodoc format. The GTK+ API documentation generator can then be used to create
documentation familiar to GTK+ developers.

--

<lupus> my plan is to do something like that in the future, but smarter
<lupus> basically, have the jit create the thunk
<lupus> so you would not have to generate code for the assemblies
<lupus> just header files, basically

--

<lupus> note that glib-allocated memory is not scammed by the GC, so you'll have to deal with that somehow
<alp> something like overriding glib's malloc with something from libgc?
<lupus> would work, but I wouldn't reccomend that
<lupus> you may need to play with weak references
<lupus> or storing the objects in something like a MonoGHashTable or something like that

--

<rachel> I would give the implementor extra points if they handled passing in wrapped objects automatically (pass in a GtkWidget*, managed gets Gtk.Widget)
