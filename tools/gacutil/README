The gacutil.exe is mostly feature complete with the ms.net impl.

Right now the gac_path is hardcoded to a very unportable value:

/usr/lib/mono/gac

This will be changed when the icall to retreive the location of the gac is put into the runtime.

NOTE: not all exceptions are caught, if you get one, file a bug and I will fix it.
