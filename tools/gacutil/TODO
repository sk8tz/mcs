Items that need to be completed, in a relative scale of importance:

1) Finish matching .net implementation.
2) Checking for valid strong names before installing to gac. (spoulit)
3) Proper uninstalling, right now it only works on a AssemblyName.Name 
	basically, so any assemblies in the gac with that name will be removed.
4) Code audit.
5) Implement local assembly cache.
