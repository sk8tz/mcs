	* MonoXSD.cs: Moved things around, now it's not only
	static methods (functions) anymore.

	Attributes handling galore! We now handle:

	   - XmlElementAttribute
	   - XmlAttributeAtribute
	   - XmlArrayAttribute
	   - XmlArrayItemAttribute
	   - XmlTextAttribute
	   - XmlAnyElementAttribute
	   - XmlAnyAttributeAttribute

	* MonoXSD.cs: More refinements. We now support transforming
	enumerations as well as arrays to their corresponding XML Schema
	type. Read/Write properties will also be transformed (thanks to
	reading KeithBa's book). XmlNode is properly handled, and XmlElement
	& co. should also be transformed correctly.
	
	Next up: I should look into whether or not xsd.exe makes use of
	XmlAttributes. If so, I'll have to support that.
	
	Other than that, this part of MonoXSD should be complete.

	* MonoXSD.cs: A simple implementation of MonoXSD. It current
	supports creating an XML Schema based on a .NET assembly. The
	handling of schema derivation is simplistic.
