A better way of displaying Custom Attributes needs to be used, so that the
actual properties/field values of the custom attribute is displayed.

A better way of specifying Assemblies on the command line.  It would be useful
to say ``-a foo.dll -a bar.dll -a baz.dll'' instead of 
``-a foo.dll:bar.dll:baz.dll''.  The framework for such parsing is described
in ``ProgramOptions.cs''.

A plug-in architecture for output formats.

Any of the TODO items listed in ``ProgramOptions.cs''.
