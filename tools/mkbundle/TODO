Tasks necessary to complete the embedding:

	* Allow --static flag (very important).

		* Provide a mono-static .pc file that can be used with this tool.

		* Provide a way to allow the user to pass extra options to gcc
		  (to control how to get libicu statically linked for example).

		* Warn if the user is using ICU?
	
	* Pass the main executable as the first argument to the
	  mono_main routine so it starts executing it.

Files:

	* Need to trace a typical execution and locate the files that this
	  will require at runtime, provide hooks of some form.

Independently:

	* Turn off ICU by default in Mono anyways?
