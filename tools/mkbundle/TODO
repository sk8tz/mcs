Tasks necessary to complete the embedding:

	* Pass the main executable as the first argument to the
	  mono_main routine so it starts executing it.

Files:

	* Need to trace a typical execution and locate the files that this
	  will require at runtime, provide hooks of some form.

Windows Issues:

	* --static is not supported and probably it will never be,
	  because the libgc code must reside in a DLL.

	* Document that the following DLLs are required to be deployed
	  along with the bundle. Do we need some legal blub if we
	  incite the user to deploy these binaries?

		[Mm]ono*.dll
		libglib*.dll
		libgmodule*.dll
		libgthread*.dll
		iconv.dll
		intl.dll
		zlib1.dll
