Tasks necessary to complete the embedding:

	* Pass the main executable as the first argument to the
	  mono_main routine so it starts executing it.

Files:

	* Need to trace a typical execution and locate the files that this
	  will require at runtime, provide hooks of some form.

Windows Issues:

--static doesn't work because libmono.a is not distributed with the
Windows package.

Not a big deal, because the needed dlls can be simply distributed with
the mkbundle-generated executable.

For example, a bundled XSP needs:

mono-1.dll
libglib*.dll
libgmodule*.dll
libgthread*.dll
iconv.dll
intl.dll

(roundabout 10MB). This seems to be the minimal working set of dlls
that have to be distributed with a bundled application.

-z doesn't work due to some weird cygwin zlib problems.
