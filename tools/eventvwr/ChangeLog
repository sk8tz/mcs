	* EventViewer.cs: Do not hide selection when focus is moved away from
	entry list.
	* Makefile: Added 'test' target. Set MONO_EVENTLOG_TYPE environment
	variable to make it easier to run tests.
	* test.cs: Added test script for creating event sources and writing
	some event entries.

	* Makefile: Use standalone makefile as we cannot rely on the mcs build
	system.
