TODO
----

	* Need to distinguish between static and instance things
	* Show the base class (public class Foo : Bar)
	* Add options like /show-private. For example, if you view System.String
	  you should only see public methods etc unless you specify /private. Similar
	  thing for other scope things.
	* Add support for events
	* Support for params (show the params keyword)
	* Support for out (it shows as ref)
	* Handle interfaces:
		* public class Foo : Blah, IBar
		* handle explicit vs. implicit impl
	* Show virtual/override?
	* Fields
	* Show valuetypes as `struct'
	* Do enums
	* Do delegates
