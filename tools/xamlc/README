This is my xaml compiler, being written as part of Google's summer of code
program.

Xaml is a language for concisely describing how to connect up a bunch of 
objects. As an example, in the avalon world:
<Window Title="Hi!">
  <Button>Click</Button>
</Window>

Would produce a child of Window where the constructor does this:
this.Title = "Hi!";
Button button = new Button();
window.AddChild(button);
button.AddText("Click");

Except of course it can handle trees of arbitrary depth, so descriptions of
complicated GUIs are not a problem and much more readable than the code
version.

To use this thing:
cd ../WindowsBase
make install
cd class/PresentationFramework
make install
cd ../../tools/xamlc
make install

That will get everything compiled. There's a demo in the mcs/tools/xamlc/demo
directory; to run it, cd into that directory and do "make run". Stuff should 
happen, along the lines of a program test.exe being generated and run to 
produce this output:
IT BEGINS!
Hello World
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You should be able to see how that's made from the included test.xaml file
