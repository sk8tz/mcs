This file contains a list of things which are unclear, confusing or
simply wrong in the microsoft docs. We keep a list of such things
here so that we can show them to the Microsoft people later on to
help them fix their documentation and class libraries.

* String.Compare (String, Int32, String, Int32, Int32):

  The documentation is a bit confusing.

  In the "Remarks" section it says

  >> The number of characters compared is the lesser of the length of
     strA less indexA, the length of strB less indexB, and length.

  In the "Exception" section it says a condition for the
  ArgumentOutOfRangeException

  >> The sum of indexA and length is greater than strA. Length. 
  >> -or-
  >> The sum of indexB and length is greater than strB. Length.
  >> -or-
  >> indexA, indexB, or length is negative.

  The latter implies that Compare ("ab", 0, "abcdef", 0, 3) will
  throw an exception - but the "Remarks" section implies that it will
  not. Both mscorlib.dll and our class libraries behave according to
  the "Remarks" section.
